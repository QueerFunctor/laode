\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c12.4.1a} -- \ref{c12.4.1d} find annihilators 
for each of the given functions.
\begin{exercise}  \label{c12.4.1a}
$g(t) = e^{4t}\cos(5t)$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The equation
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 8\frac{dx}{dt} + 41x = 0
\]
is an annihilator for $g(t)$.

\soln The function $g(t) = e^{4t}\cos(5t)$ is a solution to any differential
equation which has $\lambda_1 = 4 \pm 5i$ as an eigenvalue.  The
simplest characteristic polynomial with $\lambda_1$ as a root is
$\lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 41$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}  \label{c12.4.1b}
$g(t) = e^t-1$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The equation
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \frac{dx}{dt} = 0
\]
is an annihilator for $g(t)$.

\soln The function $g(t) = e^t - 1$ is a solution to any differential equation
which has $\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_2 = 0$ as eigenvalues.  The
simplest characteristic polynomial with $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ as
roots is $\lambda^2 - \lambda$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}  \label{c12.4.1c}
$g(t) = t^2e^{2t}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The equation
\[
\frac{d^3x}{dt^3} - 6\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 12\frac{dx}{dt} - 8x = 0
\]
is an annihilator for $g(t)$.

\soln The function $g(t) = t^2e^{2t}$ is a solution to any differential
equation which has $\lambda_1 = 2$ as a triple eigenvalue.  The simplest
characteristic polynomial with $\lambda_1$ as a triple root is
$(\lambda - 2)^3 = \lambda^3 - 6\lambda^2 + 12\lambda - 8$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}  \label{c12.4.1d}
$g(t) = t\cos(5t)+5\cos(t)$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The equation
\[
\frac{d^6x}{dt^6} + 51\frac{d^4x}{dt^4} + 675\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 625x = 0
\]
is an annihilator for $g(t)$.

\soln The function $g(t) = t\cos(5t) + 5\cos t$ is a solution to any
differential equation which has $\lambda_1 = \pm i$ as an eigenvalue and
$\lambda_2 = \pm 5i$ as a double eigenvalue.  The simplest characteristic
polynomial with these roots is
$(\lambda^2 + 1)(\lambda^2 + 25)^2 = \lambda^6 + 51\lambda^4 + 675\lambda^2
+ 625$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

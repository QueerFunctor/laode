\begin{exercise}  \label{c12.5.4}
Recall the sinusoidally forced second order equation \eqref{eq:uspf}
\[
\ddot x + x = \cos(\omega t).
\]
The second order differential operator that annihilates $\cos(\omega t)$ is
$q(D)=D^2+\omega^2$.  It follows that any solution to \eqref{eq:uspf} must
satisfy the fourth order equation 
\begin{equation} \label{E:ann=res}
q(D)(\ddot x + x)=0.
\end{equation}
Compute the characteristic polynomial of \eqref{E:ann=res} and its roots. Since
the roots typically form two complex conjugate pairs, observe that there is a
connection between the quasiperiodic solutions of this section and those of
Section~\ref{S:NLD}.  What is the special property of these roots that leads
to resonance and why?

\begin{solution}

The characteristic polynomial is $p(\lambda)=(\lambda^2+1)(\lambda^2+\omega^2)$. 
The roots of $p$ are $\pm i$ and $\pm\omega i$.  Therefore, solutions to the
inhomogeneous second order equations are linear combinations of sines and cosines with
two frequencies, that is, solutions are two-frequency motions.  Resonance occurs
when the eigenvalues are multiple, that is, when $\omega=\pm 1$.  Solutions to the
fourth order equation whose characteristic polynomial is $p$ are then linear
combinations of $\cos t$, $\sin t$, $t\cos t$, and $t\sin t$.  These factors of $t$ 
lead to resonant unbounded growth.

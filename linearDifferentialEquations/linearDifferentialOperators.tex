In Section~\ref{sec:2norderinhom} we describe a powerful method for 
solving certain second order linear differential equations.  To describe 
this method, it is convenient to introduce the notion of {\em linear 
differential operators}\index{linear!differential operator}.

We denote by $D$ the simplest differential 
operator\index{differential operator}, that is,
\[
D=\frac{d}{dt}.
\]
From differential calculus we know that $D$ acts linearly on 
(differentiable) functions, that is,
\begin{eqnarray*}
D(x(t)+y(t)) & = & Dx(t) + Dy(t) \\
D(cx(t)) & = & cDx(t),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $c\in\R$.  Thus we say that $D$ is a linear differential operator.

Higher order derivatives can be written in terms of $D$, that is,
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right) = D(Dx) = D^2x,
\]
where $D^2$ is just the composition of $D$ with itself.  Similarly, 
\[
\frac{d^nx}{dt^n} = D^nx.
\]
It follows that $D^2,\ldots,D^n$ are all compositions of linear operators
and therefore each is linear.  We can even form a polynomial in $D$ by taking
linear combinations of the $D^k$.  For example,
\begin{equation}  \label{E:pdo}
D^4 - 3D^3 + D^2 -5D + 10 
\end{equation}
is a differential operator\index{differential operator}.  
We use the following polynomial notation to 
denote these operators.  Let $q(\lambda)$ be the polynomial
\[
q(\lambda) = \lambda^4 -3\lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 5\lambda +10.
\]
Then we denote the linear operator in \Ref{E:pdo} by $q(D)$.  For example,
\begin{eqnarray*}
q(D)(\sin(2t)) & = & 16\sin(2t) + 24\cos(2t) - 4\sin(2t) - 10\cos(2t) + 
10\sin(2t) \\ & = & 22\sin(2t) + 14\cos(2t).
\end{eqnarray*}


With this notation in mind, we can reformulate much of the discussion of 
higher order equations in terms of linear differential operators.  Begin by 
rewriting the homogeneous equation \Ref{eq:nconsthom} 
\[
\frac{d^nx}{dt^n}+a_{n-1}\frac{d^{n-1}x}{dt^{n-1}}+\cdots+
a_1\frac{dx}{dt}+a_0x = (D^n+a_{n-1}D^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1D+a_0)x = 0.
\]
as
\begin{equation}  \label{E:opern2}
p(D)x = 0,
\end{equation}
where $p(\lambda)$ is the characteristic 
polynomial\index{characteristic polynomial!of higher order ODE} 
of \Ref{eq:nconsthom}.

We think of the {\em differential 
operator\/}\index{differential operator} $p(D)$ as operating on 
functions (that are sufficiently differentiable). 
\begin{lemma}  \label{L:p(D)linear}
The differential operator $p(D)$ is linear, that is,
\begin{eqnarray*}
p(D)(x+y) & = & p(D)x + p(D)y \\
p(D)(cx) & = & cp(D)x,
\end{eqnarray*}
for all sufficiently differentiable functions $x$ and $y$ and all scalars $c$.
\end{lemma}
The proof is left as an exercise.  See Exercise~\ref{c12.3.lem}.

Using the linearity of these differential operators allows us to reformulate
certain aspects of Section~\ref{sec:HighOrder} in this new language.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]  Solutions to the homogeneous equation \Ref{E:opern2} are just 
functions in the null space\index{null space!of differential operator} 
of $p(D)$.  
\item[(b)]  Using operator notation we can simplify \Ref{e:elam} as
\begin{equation}  \label{e:elam2}
p(D)\left(e^{\lambda t}\right) = p(\lambda)e^{\lambda t}.
\end{equation}
It follows from \Ref{e:elam2} that the functions $e^{\lambda t}$ are 
eigenvectors\index{eigenvector!of differential operator} 
of the operator $p(D)$ with eigenvalue $p(\lambda)$.  
Usually the functions $e^{\lambda t}$ are called 
{\em eigenfunctions}\index{eigenfunction}.
Perversely, we follow convention and reserve the term eigenvalue just 
for those $\lambda$ that are roots of the characteristic polynomial, that 
is, those values of $\lambda$ for which $p(\lambda)=0$.
\item[(c)]  We can rewrite the 
inhomogeneous\index{inhomogeneous} equation as:
\[
p(D)x = g.
\]
Showing that the inhomogeneous equation is solvable is
equivalent to showing that the 
function $g(t)$ is in the range\index{range!of differential operator} 
of the operator $p(D)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Superposition and the Inhomogeneous Equation}
\index{principle of superposition}

\begin{lemma}  \label{L:inhsup}
Let $p(\lambda)$ be a polynomial, let $g_1(t),g_2(t)$ be continuous 
functions, and let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ be scalars.  We can find a particular 
solution $x_p(t)$ to the inhomogeneous differential equation
\[
p(D)x = \alpha_1g_1(t) + \alpha_2g_2(t)
\]
by first finding solutions $x_j(t)$ to $p(D)x_j = g_j$ and then setting 
\[
x_p(t) = \alpha_1x_1(t) + \alpha_2x_2(t).
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  The proof follows directly from the linearity of $p(D)$.  Just 
compute
\[
p(D)(\alpha_1x_1 + \alpha_2x_2) = \alpha_1p(D)x_1 + 
\alpha_2p(D)x_2 = \alpha_1g_1 + \alpha_2g_2.
\]
Thus, the particular solution is a superposition of the solutions $x_1$ and
$x_2$.  \end{proof}

\subsection*{The Method of Elimination}

In Section~\ref{sec:HighOrder} we showed how to solve an $n^{th}$ order 
constant coefficient linear differential equation by converting that equation 
to a constant coefficient first order system of differential equations.  We 
now show that the process is reversible --- we can solve a first order 
system of $n$ equations by finding solutions to an associated $n^{th}$ order 
equation.  This procedure is called the {\em method of elimination\/}.
\index{method of elimination}  We first discuss this method abstractly using 
the language of differential operators and then discuss the pragmatic 
implementation of the method.

\begin{thm}  \label{T:Elimination}
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and let $p_A(\lambda)$ be the characteristic 
polynomial of $A$.  Let $X(t)=(x_1(t),\ldots,x_n(t))^t$ be a solution to the 
system of ODEs 
\[
\frac{dX}{dt} = AX.
\]
Then each coordinate function $x_j(t)$ satisfies the $n^{th}$ order 
differential equation
\begin{equation}  \label{E:Elimination}
p_A(D)x_j = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}  The proof of this theorem follows from the Cayley-Hamilton 
theorem, as follows.   Rewrite the differential equation using operator 
notation as  
\[
DX = AX,
\]
where $DX$ indicates differentiation of the vector $X(t)$ by $\frac{d}{dt}$ 
and $AX$ indicates multiplication of the vector $X(t)$ by the matrix $A$.
Since the coefficients of the matrix $A$ are constants (independent of $t$), 
it follows that $DAX=ADX$.  Hence
\[
D^2X = D(AX) = A(DX) = A^2X.
\]
Hence $D^kX = A^kX$ by induction, and $p(D)X = p(A)X$ for any polynomial $p(\lambda)$ by linearity.  The Cayley-Hamilton theorem (Theorem~\ref{T:CH} 
of Chapter~\ref{C:HDeigenvalues}) states that $p_A(A)=0$.  Hence $p_A(D)X=0$.  
So, in coordinates, $p_A(D)x_j=0$. \end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Implementation of the Method of Elimination}

Consider the first order system of differential equations
\begin{equation}  \label{E:Elim1}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & 2x-3y\\
\dot{y} & = & -5x+4y. 
\end{array}
\end{equation}
We can eliminate $y$ from the second equation in \Ref{E:Elim1} by solving for 
$y$ in the first equation, differentiating, and substituting, as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{E:Elim1a}
\begin{array}{rcl}
y & = & \frac{1}{3}(2x-\dot{x})\\
\dot{y} & = & \frac{1}{3}(2\dot{x}-\ddot{x})
\end{array}
\end{equation}
On substituting \Ref{E:Elim1a} into the second equation in \Ref{E:Elim1}, we
find
\[
\frac{1}{3}(2\dot{x}-\ddot{x}) = -5x + \frac{4}{3}(2x-\dot{x}).
\]
Simplification leads to the differential equation
\[
\ddot{x} - 6\dot{x} - 7x = 0.
\]
Since the characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix of \Ref{E:Elim1}
is $\lambda^2-6\lambda-7=(\lambda-7)(\lambda+1)$, this equation is the one 
predicted by Theorem~\ref{T:Elimination}.

Since the roots of the characteristic polynomial are $7$ and $-1$, it follows 
that $x(t)$ has the form
\[
x(t)  =  \alpha e^{7t} + \beta e^{-t}.
\]
We can solve for $y(t)$ using \Ref{E:Elim1a} and obtain
\[
y(t) = \frac{1}{3}(2x-\dot{x}) = -\frac{5}{3} \alpha e^{7t} + \beta e^{-t}.
\]
Thus the general solution to the first order system is:
\[
\vectwo{x(t)}{y(t)} = \frac{1}{3}\alpha e^{7t}\vectwo{3}{-5} + 
\beta e^{-t}\vectwo{1}{1}.
\]
Note that the vectors $(3,5)^t$ and $(1,1)^t$ are eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix of the system \Ref{E:Elim1}.

Note that the second half of the method of elimination --- in the previous 
example where we back substituted for the function $y(t)$ --- does not always 
work.  For example, if the system of differential equations decouples, then 
the second half of the method will fail.   See Exercise~\ref{c12.3.2} for an 
example. 

Thus the method of elimination provides another alternative to computing 
solutions to first order systems of differential equations; however, this 
procedure is not carried out easily for systems of more than two or three 
equations.

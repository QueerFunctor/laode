Prove Lemma~\ref{L:p(D)linear}.

\begin{solution}

To verify that $p(D)$ is a linear differential operator, observe that we have shown 
that $D^k$ is a linear operator on functions for any positive integer $k$.  Note also
that multiplication of functions by a constant $x(t)\mapsto cx(t)$ is also a linear
operator.  Therefore, $p(D)$ is the sum of linear operators and is therefore linear.

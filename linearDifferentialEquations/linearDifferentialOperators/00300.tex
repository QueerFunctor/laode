\begin{exercise}  \label{c12.3.2}
Attempt to use the method of elimination to solve the following system
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & 2x + z\\
\dot{y} & = & 3y + z\\
\dot{z} & = & z.
\end{array}
\]
Use the characteristic equation \eqref{E:Elimination} to solve for $x(t)$ and 
then attempt to use the system of differential equations to solve for $y(t)$ 
and $z(t)$.  What goes wrong?

\begin{solution}

The system of differential equations may be written in the form $\dot{X}=CX$ where
\[
C=\matthree{2}{0}{1}{0}{3}{1}{0}{0}{1}.
\]
The characteristic polynomial of $C$ =s
$p_C(\lambda)=-(\lambda-1)(\lambda-2)(\lambda-3)$.  Therefore, 
\[
x(t) = ae^t+be^{2t}+ce^{3t}
\]
for some constants $a,b,c$.  We can use the first differential equation to solve for
$z$ as
\[
z = \dot{x}-2x = ce^{3t}-ae^t.
\]
There is, however, no way to solve for $y$ directly from the given information.  The
second eqution, the only one to contain $y$, leads to solving an inhomogeneous
differential equation
\[
\dot{y} = 3y + ce^{3t}-ae^t.
\]
So the method of elimination fails in this case.  Using the characteristic equation
to solve for $y$ or $z$ first (instead of $x$) leads to similar problems.

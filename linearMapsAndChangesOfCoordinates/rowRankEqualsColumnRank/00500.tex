Let $A$ be a nonzero $3\times 3$ matrix such that $A^2=0$.  Show that
$\rank(A)=1$.

\begin{solution}

Since $A$ is a nonzero $3 \times 3$ matrix, $\rank(A)$ can equal $1$,
$2$, or $3$.  If $\rank(A) = 3$, then $A$ is invertible, so there
exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB = I_3$.  Then $A^2B^2 = AABB = I_3$,
so $\rank(A^2) = 3$, which contradicts the assumption that $A^2 = 0$.
Therefore, $\rank(A) \neq 3$.

\para Let $\rank(A) = 2$ and let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be linearly independent
vectors such that $Av_1 \neq 0$ and $Av_2 \neq 0$.  By
Theorem~\ref{T:dimsoln}, the nullity of $A$ is $1$.  However,
$A^2v = 0$ for all vectors $v$.  In particular,
\[
A^2v_1 = A(Av_1) = 0 \AND A^2v_2 = A(Av_2) = 0.
\]
Since there are linearly independent vectors $Av_1$ and $Av_2$ such
that $A(Av_1) = A(Av_2) = 0$, $\null(A) \geq 2$, contradicting
Theorem~\ref{T:dimsoln}.  Thus, $\rank(A) \neq 2$, so, by elimination
$\rank(A) = 1$.

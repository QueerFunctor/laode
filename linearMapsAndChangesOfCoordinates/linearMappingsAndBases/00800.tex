Let ${\cal M}(n)$ denote the vector space of $n\times n$
matrices and let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix.  Let
$L:{\cal M}(n)\to{\cal M}(n)$ be the mapping defined by
$L(X)=AX-XA$ where $X\in{\cal M}(n)$.  Verify that $L$ is
a linear mapping.  Show that the null space of $L$,
$\{X\in{\cal M}:L(X)=0\}$, is a subspace consisting of all
matrices that commute with $A$.

\begin{solution}

Let $X$ and $Y$ be elements of ${\cal M}(n)$.  Then,
\[ L(X + Y) = A(X + Y) - (X + Y)A = (AX - XA)
+ (AY - YA) = L(X) + L(Y). \]
For any real scalar $c$,
\[ L(cX) = A(cX) - (cX)A = c(AX) - c(XA) = c(AX - XA) = cL(X). \]
Therefore, $L$ is a linear mapping.

\para The null space of $L$ consists of all matrices $X$ such that
$AX - XA = 0$, or $AX = XA$.  By definition, these are the matrices
such that $X$ commutes with $A$.  Let $X$ and $Y$ be elements of
the null space of $L$.  Then show that $X + Y$ is in the null space
by calculating:
\[ L(X + Y) = A(X + Y) - (X + Y)A = AX + AY - XA - YA = AX + AY - AX
- AY = 0. \]
Show that, for any real scalar $c$, $cX$ is in the null space by
calculating:
\[ L(cX) = A(cX) - (cX)A = cAX - cXA = cAX - cAX = 0. \]
Therefore, the null space of $L$ is a subspace consisting of all
matrices that commute with $A$.

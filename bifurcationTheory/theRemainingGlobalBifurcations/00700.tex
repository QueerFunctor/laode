\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c9.6.5a} -- \ref{c9.6.5c}, consider the system 
of differential equations \eqref{E:saddleconn}.
\begin{matlabEquation}  \label{E:saddleconn}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & y  \\
\dot{y} & = & -x - 0.1y + x^3 + \rho x^2.
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.5a}
How many equilibria does \eqref{E:saddleconn} have for each value of 
$\rho$ and of what type are they?  

\begin{solution}

\ans For any values of $\rho$, the system has saddle points at
\[
(x,y) = (-\rho + \sqrt{\rho^2 + 4},0) \AND
(x,y) = (-\rho - \sqrt{\rho^2 + 4},0)
\]
and a spiral sink at the origin.

\soln Set $\dot{x} = \dot{y} = 0$.  Then $y = 0$, and
$0 = x^3 + \rho x^2 - x$, so there are equilibria at the origin, and at
the roots of $x^2 + \rho x - x$.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.5b}
How many bifurcations occur in \eqref{E:saddleconn} as $\rho$ is 
varied from $\rho=0.1$ to $\rho=0.2$?

\begin{solution}

One bifurcation occurs as $\rho$ is varied from $\rho = 0.1$ to $\rho = 0.2$.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.5c}
What types of bifurcation occur in \eqref{E:saddleconn} as $\rho$ is 
varied from $\rho=0.1$ to $\rho=0.2$?

\begin{solution}

A heteroclinic bifurcation occurs at $\rho \approx 0.141$.  At this
point, an unstable orbit of the leftmost saddle point coincides with a
stable orbit of the rightmost saddle point.

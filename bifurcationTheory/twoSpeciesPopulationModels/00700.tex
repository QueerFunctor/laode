\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.1.3}
Choose values for the constants in the predator-prey equations 
\eqref{e:PP} and verify numerically that there is a unique 
equilibrium surrounded by periodic solutions in the first 
quadrant of the phase portrait for these equations.

\begin{solution}

Solve \eqref{e:PP} for $\dot{x} = \dot{y} = 0$ to find that there are
two equilibrium points, at $(0,0)$ and $(-\frac{\mu_2}{\sigma_2},
-\frac{\mu_1}{\sigma_1})$.  The second equilibrium is in the first
quadrant for any values of the constants that conform to the assumed
restrictions: $\mu_1 > 0$, $\mu_2 < 0$, $\sigma_1 < 0$, and
$\sigma_2 > 0$.  Load the system into {\tt pplane5} and graph with
several values for the constants to confirm that the nonzero
equilibrium is surrounded by periodic solutions.

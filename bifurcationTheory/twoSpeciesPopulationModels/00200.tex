Consider the two predator-prey equations
\begin{equation} \label{E:prpr1}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & x(2-10y)\\
\dot{y} & = & y(-4+y)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation} \label{E:prpr2}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & x(2-0.1y)\\
\dot{y} & = & y(-4+y)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
In one of these equations the predators eat the prey 100 times more 
frequently than in the other.  Which one?

\begin{solution}

\ans Predators eat prey faster in the first system \eqref{E:prpr1} than in 
the second system \eqref{E:prpr2}.

\soln  In the predator prey system \eqref{e:PP}, the $x$ variable is the
prey population and the $y$ variable is the predator population.  The
question asks: In which system will the predator population cause a
larger decrease in the prey population.  That is, in which system is
the coefficient $\sigma_1$ in \eqref{e:PP} a larger negative number?  In
the first system $\sigma_1=-10$, while in the second system $\sigma_1=-0.1$.

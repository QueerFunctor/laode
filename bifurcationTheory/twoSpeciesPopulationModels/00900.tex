\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.1.7}
Use {\pplane} to describe the (numerical) differences between solutions 
to the differential equations \eqref{E:prpr1} and \eqref{E:prpr2}.  In particular,
compare the maximum number of prey in one equation with the maximum number of 
prey in the other equation when you start with the same number of predators 
and prey in each equation.

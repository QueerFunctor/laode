\begin{exercise} \label{c9.3.3}
Let 
\begin{eqnarray*}
g(x,y,\rho) & = &  \rho - 2x +  y + 2x^2 - y^3 \\
h(x,y,\rho) & = & 2\rho + 4x - 2y -  xy  + y^2
\end{eqnarray*}
Show that $F=(g,h)$ has a saddle-node bifurcation at $(x,y)=0$ and 
$\rho=0$.

\begin{solution}

The function $F$ has a bifurcation point at the origin when $\rho = 0$
if $F$ is in equilibrium at $(x,y,\rho) = (0,0,0)$ and $\det(F) = 0$ at
this point.  Since $g(0,0,0) = 0$ and $h(0,0,0) = 0$, the origin is an
equilibrium for $F$ when $\rho = 0$.  Then, calculate the Jacobian at
this point:
\[
J = \mattwo{-2}{1}{4}{-2}.
\]
The determinant of the Jacobian is zero so the origin is indeed a
bifurcation point when $\rho = 0$.  In order to demonstrate the
two-dimensional nondegeneracy conditions, find nonzero vectors $v$ and
$w$ such that $Jv = 0$ and $J^tw = 0$.  In this case, $v = (1,2)^t$ and
$w = (2,1)^t$.  Then, compute
\[
w \cdot F_\rho(0,0,0) = \vectwo{2}{1} \cdot \vectwo{1}{2} =
4 \neq 0,
\]
so \eqref{e:2deig} is satisfied.  In order to satisfy \eqref{e:2dbifur},
compute
\[
g_{xx} = 4, \quad
g_{xy} = 0, \quad
g_{yy} = -6y, \quad
h_{xx} = 0, \quad
h_{xy} = -1, \quad
h_{yy} = 2.
\]
and evaluate
\[
F_0 = \vectwo{4}{0} + 4\vectwo{0}{-1} + 4\vectwo{0}{2} =
\vectwo{4}{1}.
\]
Then, since $w \cdot F_0 = 9 \neq 0$, the second nondegeneracy condition
is satisfied, and the origin is indeed a saddle node bifurcation for $F$
when $\rho = 0$.

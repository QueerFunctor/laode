\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c9.6.1a} -- \ref{c9.6.1b} find points of Hopf
bifurcation and check for these points whether the eigenvalue crossing
condition \eqref{e:2dhopf} is satisfied.
\begin{exercise} \label{c9.6.1a}
$\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & \rho x - y -x^3 \\
\dot{y} & = & x.
\end{array}$

\begin{solution}

\ans The only equilibria of this system occur at the origin and a point of
Hopf bifurcation occurs at $\rho=0$.  The eigenvalue crossing condition is
satisfied.

\soln  To find the equilibria solve $\dot{y}=0$ for $x=0$ and $\dot{x}=0$ for
$y=0$.  The Jacobian matrix at the origin is 
\[
J(\rho) = \mattwo{\rho}{-1}{1}{0}.
\]
Thus, $\trace(J(\rho))=0$ only when $\rho=0$.  So a Hopf bifurcation point
can only occur at $\rho=0$.  Finally, note that 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\trace(J(\rho)) = 1 \neq 0;
\]
So the eigenvalue crossing condition is satisfied.

\begin{exercise} \label{c9.6.1b}
$\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & y - \rho x - x^2   \\
\dot{y} & = & -x - \rho y + x^2.
\end{array}$

\begin{solution}

\ans  There are two possible points of Hopf bifurcation: one at $(0,0)$ 
when $\rho=0$ and $(1,0)$ at $\rho=-1$.  The eigenvalue crossing condition is
satisfied at both points.

\soln  The system of differential equations
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & y - \rho x - x^2   \\
\dot{y} & = & -x - \rho y + x^2.
\end{array}
\]
has Jacobian matrix 
\[
J = \cmattwo{-\rho-2x}{1}{-1+2x}{-\rho}.
\]
Since a point of Hopf bifurcation must be at an equilibrium where the trace
of the Jacobian matrix is zero, points of Hopf bifurcation must satisfy the
three equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y - \rho x - x^2 & = & 0\\
-x - \rho y + x^2 & = & 0\\
-2\rho-2x & = & 0.
\end{eqnarray*}
On substituting $\rho = -x$ into the first two equations, we obtain:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y  & = & 0\\
-x + xy + x^2 & = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}
From these equations we see that there are two possible points of Hopf
bifurcation $(0,0)$ at $\rho=0$ or $(1,0)$ at $\rho=-1$.  

To check the eigenvalue crossing condition we must compute the trace of the
Jacobian matrix along the branch of equilibria.  To find the branches we must
solve the equilibrium equations
\begin{eqnarray*}
y - \rho x - x^2 & = & 0\\
-x - \rho y + x^2 & = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}
for $x$ and $y$ as a function of $\rho$.  Substituting $y - \rho x+x^2$ into
the $2^{nd}$ equation yields:
\[
-(1+\rho^2)x + (1-\rho)x^2 = 0.
\]
Therefore either 
\[
x= 0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  x = \frac{1+\rho^2}{1-\rho}.
\]
If $x=0$, then $y=0$ and the trace of the Jacobian along this branch is
$-2\rho$.  Since the derivative with respect to $\rho$ equals $-2$, the
eigenvalue crossing condition is satisfied.

In the second case, the trace of the Jacobian along the branch of equilibria
equals
\[
-2\rho-2x = -2\rho -2\frac{1+\rho^2}{1-\rho}.
\]
The derivative of this expression with respect to $\rho$ is $3$ at $\rho=-1$.
Hence the eigenvalue crossing condition is satisfied.

\begin{exercise}  \label{E:PQf}
$C = \mattwo{2}{2}{-2}{-2}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is not hyperbolic, and the equilibrium at
the origin is a shear.

\soln The trace and determinant of $C$ are both zero, so the origin
is not hyperbolic.  Since $C$ is not the zero matrix, the equilibrium
at the origin is a shear.

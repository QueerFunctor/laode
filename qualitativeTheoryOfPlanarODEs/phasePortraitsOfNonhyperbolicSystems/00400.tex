$C = \mattwo{1}{-1}{2}{1}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is hyperbolic, and the equilibrium at the origin
is a spiral source.

\soln The trace and determinant of $C$ are both nonzero, so the origin
is hyperbolic.  Since $\det(C) = 3 > 0$ and $\trace(C) = 2 > 0$,
the equilibrium at the origin is a source.  Since the discriminant
$D \equiv \trace(C)^2 - 4\det(C) = -8 < 0$, the origin is a spiral.

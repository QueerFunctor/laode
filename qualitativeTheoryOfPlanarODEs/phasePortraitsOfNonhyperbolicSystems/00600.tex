$C = \mattwo{3}{-1}{1}{1}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is hyperbolic, and the equilibrium at the origin
is an improper nodal source.

\soln The trace and determinant of $C$ are both nonzero, so the origin
is hyperbolic.  Since $\det(C) = 4 > 0$ and $\trace(C) = 4 > 0$,
the equilibrium at the origin is a source.  Since the discriminant
$D \equiv \trace(C)^2 - 4\det(C) = 0$, the eigenvalues of $C$ are equal.
Since $C$ is not a multiple of $I_2$, $C$ has only one eigenvector, so
the origin is an improper node.

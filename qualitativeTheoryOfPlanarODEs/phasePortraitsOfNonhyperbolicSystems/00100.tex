\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c6.9.1a} -- \ref{c6.9.1b}, find a $2\times 2$
matrix $C$ so that the differential equation $\dot{X}=CX$ satisfies the
given condition.
\begin{exercise} \label{c6.9.1a}
The origin is a center.

\begin{solution}
\ans One such matrix is $C = \mattwo{0}{-1}{1}{0}$.

\soln More generally, for any matrix
\[
C = \mattwo{\sigma}{-\tau}{\tau}{\sigma}
\]
such that $\sigma = 0$ and $\tau \neq 0$, the differential equation
$\dot{X} = CX$ will have the origin as a center.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c6.9.1b}
The origin is a saddle-node with equilibria on the line generated by the
vector $(-1,2)$.

\begin{solution}
\ans One such matrix is $C = \mattwo{0}{0}{2}{1}$.

\soln Saddle nodes are generated by systems with eigenvalues $\lambda_1
= 0$ and $\lambda_2 \neq 0$.  All trajectories converge on the
eigenvector associated to eigenvalue $0$, so $v_1 = (-1,2)$ is the
eigenvector associated to $\lambda_1$.  Let $v_2 = (0,1)$ be the
eigenvector associated to $\lambda_2$, and let $\lambda_2 = 1$.  Then,
according to Theorem~\ref{T:putinform}, $C
= PDP^{-1}$, where $D$ is the diagonal matrix will $\lambda_1$ and
$\lambda_2$ along the main diagonal, and $P = (v_1|v_2)$.  Thus,
\[
C = \mattwo{-1}{0}{2}{1}\mattwo{0}{0}{0}{1}\mattwo{-1}{0}{2}{1}
= \mattwo{0}{0}{2}{1}.
\]

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

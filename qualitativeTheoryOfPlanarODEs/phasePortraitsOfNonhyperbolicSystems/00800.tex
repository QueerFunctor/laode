$C = \mattwo{2}{-2}{4}{-2}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is not hyperbolic, and the equilibrium at
the origin is a center.

\soln Since $\det(C) = 4 > 0$ and $\trace(C) = 0$, the origin is not
hyperbolic and $C$ has purely imaginary eigenvalues.  Thus, the
equilibrium at the origin is a center.

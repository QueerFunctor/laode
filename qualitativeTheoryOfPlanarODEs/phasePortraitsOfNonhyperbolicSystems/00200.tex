\begin{exercise} \label{c6.9.2}
Recall from Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar}, \eqref{ex:uspring} that the undamped
spring equation is $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \kappa x = 0$, where $\kappa>0$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]   As a first order system this equation is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{x} & = & y \\
\dot{y} & = & -\kappa x.
\end{eqnarray*}
Sketch the phase portrait of this equation.
\item[(b)]  The damped spring equation, written as a first order system, is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\dot{x} & = & y \\
\dot{y} & = & -\kappa x-\sigma y,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\sigma>0$ is the damping.  Sketch the phase portrait of this equation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

Three trajectories of the undamped equation are shown in Figure~\ref{c6.9.2}a,
and one trajectory of the damped equation is shown in Figure~\ref{c6.9.2}b.

%(a) \ans The first order linear system corresponding to \eqref{ex:uspring} is
%\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
%\dot{x} & = & y \\
%\dot{y} & = & -\kappa x. \end{array}
%\]
%\soln  The equation \eqref{ex:uspring} is a special case of \eqref{E:2ndorder}
%in which $a(x) = 0$ and $b(x) = \kappa$.

%(b) \ans The damped first order linear system is
%\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
%\dot{x} & = & y \\
%\dot{y} & = & -\kappa x -\sigma y. \end{array}
%\]
%\soln When friction is taken into account, the second order
%differential equation is
%\[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \sigma\frac{dx}{dt} + \kappa x = 0, \]
%which is also a special case of \eqref{E:2ndorder}.  In this case,
%$a(x) = \sigma$ and $b(x) = \kappa$.

%(c) The three sample trajectories for the solution to the
%frictionless system (Figure \ref{c3.5.6}a) are ellipses
%around the origin.  This makes sense, since $|x|$ (the distance
%of the spring from its natural position) is at a maximum when
%$|y|$ (the speed of the spring's motion) is $0$.  The sample
%trajectory for the damped system (Figure \ref{c3.5.6}b) 
%is a spiral, since friction
%both slows the spring and shortens the distance of motion until
%the spring comes to rest at its natural length.

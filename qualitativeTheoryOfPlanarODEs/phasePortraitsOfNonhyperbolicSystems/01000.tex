\begin{exercise}  \label{E:PQg}
$C = \mattwo{1}{1}{4}{1}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is hyperbolic, and the equilibrium at the origin
is a saddle.

\soln The trace and determinant of $C$ are both nonzero, so the origin
is hyperbolic.  Since $\det(C) = -3 < 0$, the equilibrium at the origin 
is a saddle.

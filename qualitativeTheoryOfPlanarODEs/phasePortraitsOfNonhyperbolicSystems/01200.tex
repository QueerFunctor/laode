\begin{computerExercise}  \label{E:notcircles}
Consider the system of differential equations $\dot{X}=CX$ where
$C=\mattwo{2}{-10}{1}{-2}$.  By hand show that this system is a center and
use {\pplane} to determine its phase portrait.  Describe both the
similarities and the differences of the phase portrait of this system
and the phase portrait in Figure~\ref{F:center}.

\begin{solution}

By definition, a system $\dot{X} = CX$ is a center if the eigenvalues
of $C$ are purely imaginary.  This occurs when $\det(C) > 0$ and
$\trace(C) = 0$.  In this case, $\det(C) = 6$ and $\trace(C) = 0$, so
the system is indeed a center.  The phase portrait is shown in
Figure~\ref{E:notcircles}.  In this phase portrait and in the one
shown in Figure~\ref{F:center}, all
trajectories are closed ellipses.  However, the trajectories in
Figure~\ref{F:center} are circular, while the ones in this exercise
are not.  This is true because Figure~\ref{F:center} graphs the system
$\dot{X} = BX$, where
\[ B = \mattwo{0}{-\tau}{\tau}{0}, \]
while this problem graphs the system $\dot{X} = CX$, where $C = 
PBP^{-1}$ and $P \neq I_2$.

\begin{exercise} \label{c6.8.3}
Each picture in Figure~\ref{F:E:timeseries} is the time series of a
solution to a planar system of differential equations of the form
$\dot{X}=CX$.  Describe the eigenvalues of $C$ and determine the type
of planar phase for each of these systems.

\begin{solution}

In the figure on the left, $x$ oscillates away from the origin as $t$
increases, so the origin is a spiral source.  Therefore, the eigenvalues
of $C$ are a complex conjugate pair with positive real part.

\para In the figure on the right, both $x$ and $y$ cross $0$, then
tend back towards $0$ from the opposite direction.  Therefore, the origin
is an improper nodal sink, so the eigenvalues are real, equal and
negative, and there is one independent eigenvector.

\end{solution}

\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c6.8.4a} -- \ref{c6.8.4b}, use {\pplane} to
determine the type of phase portrait for the systems of differential equations
$\dot{X}=CX$ where $C$ is the given matrix.  Based on these computations
answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Is the origin asymptotically stable?
\item[(b)]  How many real eigenvectors does the matrix $C$ have?
\end{itemize}

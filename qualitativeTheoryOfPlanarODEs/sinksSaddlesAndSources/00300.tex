\noindent In Exercises~\ref{E:sssa} -- \ref{E:sssd} use {\pplane} to
determine whether the origin is a saddle, sink, or source in $\dot{X}=CX$
for the given matrix $C$.
\begin{computerExercise} \label{E:sssa}
$C=\mattwoc{10}{-2.7}{4.32}{1.6}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is a source.

\soln Enter the system into {\pplane}.  Then compute trajectories with
different initial conditions and note that all trajectories go away from
the origin in forward time.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{E:sssb}
$C=\mattwoc{-10}{-2.7}{4.32}{1.6}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is a saddle.

\soln Enter the system into {\pplane}.  Then compute trajectories with
different initial conditions and note that some trajectories approach the
origin in forward time, while some approach the origin in backward time.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{E:sssc}
$C=\mattwoc{-1}{2}{4.76}{1.5}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is a saddle.

\soln Enter the system into {\pplane}.  Then compute trajectories with
different initial conditions and note that some trajectories approach the
origin in forward time, while some approach the origin in backward time.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{E:sssd}
$C=\mattwo{-2}{-2}{4}{1}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The origin is a sink.

\soln Enter the system into {\pplane}.  Then compute trajectories with
different initial conditions and note that all trajectories approach
the origin in forward time.


\end{solution}

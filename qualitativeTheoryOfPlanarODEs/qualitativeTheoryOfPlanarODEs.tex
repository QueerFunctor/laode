Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar} discussed three methods that are used to solve
planar systems of linear, constant coefficient, ordinary differential
equations.  The last method is based on similarity and the explicit
computation of the matrix exponential for certain normal form matrices.
This method depends crucially on the classification of $2\times 2$ matrices
up to similarity given in Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar}, 
Theorem~\ref{T:putinform}.

In this chapter we explore qualitative features of phase portraits for planar 
linear systems of differential equations using similarity.  We find that the 
qualitative theory is completely determined by the eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix --- which is not surprising given
that we can classify matrices up to similarity by just knowing their
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  The set of planar phase portraits divides 
systems of linear differential equations into two camps: {\em hyperbolic\/} 
and {\em nonhyperbolic\/}.  The hyperbolic systems consist of {\em saddles\/},
{\em sinks\/} and {\em sources\/}, while the nonzero nonhyperbolic systems 
consist of {\em centers\/}, {\em saddle nodes\/}, and {\em shears\/}.

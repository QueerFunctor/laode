Find the matrix that reflects the plane across the line generated by the
vector $(1,2)$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The matrix that reflects the plane across $(1,2)$ is
\[
H = \mattwo{-\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{3}{5}}.
\]

\soln The matrix that reflects the plane across $(1,2)$ is the
Householder matrix associated to the vector $u$, where $u \cdot (1,2)
= 0$.  Compute $H$, the Householder matrix associated to $u = (2,-1)$.

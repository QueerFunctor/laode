In Section~\ref{S:orthonormal} we discuss orthonormal bases --- bases in
which each basis vector has unit length and any two basis vectors are 
perpendicular.
We will see that the computation of coordinates in an orthonormal basis is
particularly straightforward.  We
use orthonormality in Section~\ref{S:LSA} to study the geometric problem of
least squares approximations (given a point $v$ and a subspace $W$, find
the point in $W$ closest to $v$) and in Section~\ref{S:symmetric} to study
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices (the eigenvalues are
real and the eigenvectors can be chosen to be orthonormal).  We present two
applications of least squares approximations:  the  Gram-Schmidt
orthonormalization process for constructing orthonormal bases
(Section~\ref{S:LSA}) and regression or least squares fitting of data
(Section~\ref{S:7.6}).   The chapter ends with a discussion of the $QR$
decomposition for finding orthonormal bases in Section~\ref{S:QR}.  This
decomposition leads to an algorithm that is numerically superior to
Gram-Schmidt and is the one used in \Matlabp.

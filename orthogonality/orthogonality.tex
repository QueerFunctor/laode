In Section~\ref{S:orthonormal} we discuss orthonormal bases (bases in
which each basis vector has unit length and any two basis vectors are 
perpendicular) and orthogonal matrices (matrices whose columns form an orthonormal basis).
We will see that the computation of coordinates in an orthonormal basis is
particularly straightforward.  
The  Gram-Schmidt
orthonormalization process for constructing orthonormal bases is presented in 
Section~\ref{S:GSO}.  We
use orthogonality in Section~\ref{S:symmetric} to study
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices (the eigenvalues are
real and the eigenvectors can be chosen to be orthonormal).   The chapter ends with a discussion of the $QR$
decomposition for finding orthonormal bases in Section~\ref{S:QR}.  This
decomposition leads to an algorithm that is numerically superior to
Gram-Schmidt and is the one used in \Matlabp.

\begin{exercise} \label{c7.4.1}
Find an orthonormal basis for the solutions to the linear equation
\[
2x_1-x_2+x_3=0.
\]

\begin{solution}

\ans The vectors $w_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(1,1,-1)$ and
$w_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,1,1)$ form an orthonormal basis
for the solution set.

\soln Find one vector which is a solution to the equation, for
example $(1,1,-1)$.  Then, divide the vector by its length, obtaining
the unit vector $w_1$.  By inspection, find a vector $v_2$ which
satisfies both the given equation and $w_1 \cdot v_2 = 0$.  Then set
$w_2 = \frac{1}{||v_2||}v_2$.

      By using \textbf{linear algebra} seemingly different ``linear''
      things in algebra, geometry, and calculus---things like systems
      of certain equations, rigid motions in geometry, certain
      differential equations---are placed in a common framework of
      vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

      \vspace{1ex}
      
      Viewing different things as somehow analogous provides not only
      insight, but also a common toolkit of surprisingly powerful
      algorithms.

      \vspace{1ex}

      This book introduces you in the theory of vector spaces, but
      also to the practical considerations of using a computer to
      carry out such algorithms.

      \textbf{On the cover} we see a photograph of a Metro station.
      The perspective in the photograph evokes ``lines'' while the
      coffered ceiling suggests the way linear algebra is used in
      multivariable calculus to approximate curved objects via 
      tangent planes.  The engineering behind the construction of a
      transit system certainly relies on linear algebra, but
      day-to-day operations---scheduling, fares, etc.---are another
      place where linear algebra is used.  \textbf{Our modern
        technological world is built on a foundation of linear
        algebra.}

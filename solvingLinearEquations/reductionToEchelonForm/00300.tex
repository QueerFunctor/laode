\begin{exercise} \label{c2.4.2b}
The augmented matrix of a consistent system of nine equations in twelve
unknowns has rank equal to five.  How many parameters are needed to
specify all solutions?
\begin{prompt}
  There are $\answer{7}$ parameters needed to specify all solutions.
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
  According to Theorem \ref{number}, $n - \ell$
parameters are needed to parameterize the set of all solutions of a
linear system, where $n$ is the number of unknowns, and $\ell$ is the
rank of the reduced echelon matrix.  In this case, $n = 12$ and $\ell =
5$.
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

\ans Seven parameters are needed to specify all solutions.

\begin{exercise} \label{c2.4.2}
The augmented matrix of a consistent system of five equations in seven
unknowns has rank equal to three.  How many parameters are needed to
specify all solutions?
\begin{prompt}
  There are $\answer{4}$ parameters needed to specify all solutions.
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
  According to Theorem \ref{number}, $n - \ell$
parameters are needed to parameterize the set of all solutions of a
linear system, where $n$ is the number of unknowns, and $\ell$ is the
rank of the reduced echelon matrix.  In this case, $n = 7$ and $\ell =
3$.
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

\ans Four parameters are needed to specify all solutions.

\soln According to Theorem \ref{number}, $n - \ell$

linear system, where $n$ is the number of unknowns, and $\ell$ is the
rank of the reduced echelon matrix.  In this case, $n = 7$ and $\ell =

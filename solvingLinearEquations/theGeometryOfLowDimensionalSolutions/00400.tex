\begin{exercise} \label{c2.2.7}
Write the equation of the plane through the origin containing the
vectors $(1,0,1)$ and $(2,-1,2)$.
\begin{prompt}
  The equation for the plane is $z = \answer{x}$.
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
  Note that the plane goes through the origin and contains the
vectors $(1,0,1)$ and $(2,-1,2)$, and therefore contains the points
$(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, and $(2,-1,2)$.  The general equation for a plane
is $ax + by + cz = d$.  We can substitute the coordinates of the three
points into this equation to get the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
 & & & & 0 & = & d \\
a & & & + & c & = & d \\
2a & - & b & + & 2c & = & d\end{array}
\]
We can solve the system by substitution to get $b = d = 0$ and $a = -c$,
which yields the equation of the plane.
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

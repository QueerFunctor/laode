\begin{exercise} \label{c2.2.5}
Find the equation for the plane perpendicular to the vector $(2,3,1)$
and containing the point $(-1,-2,3)$.
\begin{prompt}
  The equation of the desired plane is $\answer{2}x + \answer{3}y + z = -5$.
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
  Note that a vector perpendicular to a plane is orthogonal
to any vector connecting two points in the plane.  So,
if $X_0 = (-1,-2,3)$ is one point in the plane perpendicular to
$N = (2,3,1)$ and $X = (x,y,z)$ is any other point in that plane,
then $(X - X_0) \cdot N = 0$.  Substituting into this formula, we obtain
\[
2(x + 1) + 3(y + 1) + 1(z - 3) = 0\quad\mbox{or}\quad
2x + 3y + z = -5.
\]
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

\ans The equation of the desired plane is $2x + 3y + z = -5$.

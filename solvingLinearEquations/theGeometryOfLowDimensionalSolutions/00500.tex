\begin{exercise} \label{c2.2.8}
Find a system of two linear equations in three
unknowns whose solution set is the line consisting of scalar
multiples of the vector $(1,2,1)$.

\begin{prompt}
  For example, one such system is:
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & - & y & + & z & = & 0 \\
\answer{2}x & + & y & - & \answer{4}z & = & 0\end{array}
\]
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
  The solution set contains all multiples of the vector $(1,2,1)$,
so it contains the origin, since $0(1,2,1) = (0,0,0)$.  The equation
of any plane containing the origin is $ax + by + cz = 0$. 
Substituting the point $(1,2,1)$ implies that $a + 2b + c = 0$. 
Any two equations which satisfy that condition and are not multiples
of one another will have the appropriate line as a solution set. 
For example, let $(a,b,c) = (1,-1,1)$ in the first equation, and
$(a,b,c) = (2,1,-4)$ in the second equation to obtain the system
given here.
\end{hint}

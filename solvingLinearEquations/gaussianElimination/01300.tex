\noindent {\bf Observation:} {\rm In standard format \Matlab displays
all nonzero real numbers with four decimal places while it displays
zero as $0$.  An unfortunate consequence of this display is that
when a matrix has both zero and noninteger entries, the columns
will not align --- which is a nuisance.  You can work with
rational numbers rather than decimal numbers by typing {\tt
format rational}.  Then the columns will align.}

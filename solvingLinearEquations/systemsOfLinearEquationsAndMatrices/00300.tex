\begin{exercise} \label{c2.1.9}
Neither of the following systems of three equations in three
unknowns has a unique solution --- but for different
reasons.  Solve these systems and explain why these systems
cannot be solved uniquely.
\[
\mbox{(a) }\; \begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
  x & - &  y &   &    & = &  4\\
  x & + & 3y & - & 2z & = & -6\\
 4x & + & 2y & - & 3z & = &  1
              \end{array}
            \]
            and
            \[\mbox{(b) }\; \begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
 2x & - & 4y & + & 3z & = &  4\\
 3x & - & 5y & + & 3z & = &  5\\
    &   & 2y & - & 3z & = & -4
\end{array}
\]
\begin{prompt}
  The matrix in part~(a) has
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{No solutions.}    
    \choice{Exactly one solution.}
    \choice[correct]{Infinitely many solutions.}
  \end{multipleChoice}

  The matrix in part~(b) has
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{No solutions.}    
    \choice{Exactly one solution.}
    \choice{Infinitely many solutions.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
\end{prompt}

\begin{hint}
For part~(a), replace $x$ in the second and third equations with
$4 + y$ to obtain $4y - 2z = -10$ and $6y - 3z = -15$.  Since these
equations have identical solutions, the system can be restated as
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & = & y & + & 4 \\ 
z & = & -2y & + & 5\end{array}
\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
So, for each choice of $y$, there exists a single solution.  For
example, if $y = 1$, then $x = 5$ and $z = 3$; or if $y = 0$, then
$x = 4$ and $z = 5$.  
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
For part~(b), if we again substitute for $x$ using the first equation, the
second and third equations become
\[
2y - 3z = -2 \AND 2y - 3z = -4
\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
These two expressions contradict each other, so there is no solution
for this system.  
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

\ans The system in part (a) has an infinite number of solutions, whereas
the system in part (b) has no solution.

\soln (a) Replace $x$ in the second and third equations with
$4 + y$ to obtain $4y - 2z = -10$ and $6y - 3z = -15$.  Since these
equations have identical solutions, the system can be restated as
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & = & y & + & 4 \\ 
z & = & -2y & + & 5\end{array}
\]
So, for each choice of $y$, there exists a single solution.  For
example, if $y = 1$, then $x = 5$ and $z = 3$; or if $y = 0$, then
$x = 4$ and $z = 5$.

(b) If we again substitute for $x$ using the first equation, the
second and third equations become
\[
2y - 3z = -2 \AND 2y - 3z = -4
\]

These two expressions contradict each other, so there is no solution
for this system.

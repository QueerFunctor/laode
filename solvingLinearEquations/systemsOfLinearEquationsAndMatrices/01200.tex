The \Matlab command {\tt rand(m,n)}\index{\computer!rand} defines
matrices with random
entries between $0$ and $1$.  For example, the command {\tt A =
rand(5,5)} generates a random $5\times 5$ matrix, whereas the
command {\tt b = rand(5,1)} generates a column vector with $5$
random entries.  Use these commands to construct several systems
of linear equations and then solve them.

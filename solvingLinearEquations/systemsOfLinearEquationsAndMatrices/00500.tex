\begin{exercise} \label{c2.1.11}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find a quadratic polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
  satisfying $p(0) = 1$, $p(1) = 5$, and $p(-1) = -5$.
  \begin{prompt}
    The quadratic $p(x) = \answer{-x^2 + 5x + 1}$ satisfies these conditions.
  \end{prompt}
  \begin{hint}
    Since $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for any quadratic equation, we find
this solution by evaluating $p(0) = 1$, $p(1) = 5$, and $p(-1) = -5$,
which yields the system of equations
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrr}
p(0) & = & & & & & c & = & 1 \\
p(1) & = & a & + & b & + & c & = & 5 \\
p(-1) & = & a & - & b & + & c & = & -5\end{array}
\]
We solve this system to obtain $(a,b,c) = (-1,5,1)$, then substitute
these coefficients into the general quadratic.
  \end{hint}
\item[(b)] Prove that for every triple of real numbers $L$, $M$,
and $N$, there is a quadratic polynomial satisfying $p(0) = L$,
$p(1) = M$, and $p(-1) = N$.
\begin{hint}
   Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic equation.  Then, the
assumptions $p(0) = L$, $p(1) = M$, and $p(-1) = N$ imply:
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrr}
p(0) & = & & & & & c & = & L \\
p(1) & = & a & + & b & + & c & = & M \\
p(-1) & = & a & - & b & + & c & = & N\end{array}
\]
The unique solution to this system is $(a,b,c) =
(\frac{M + N - 2L}{2},\frac{M - N}{2},L)$.
\end{hint}
\item[(c)] Let $x_1,x_2,x_3$ be three unequal real
numbers and let $A_1,A_2,A_3$ be three real numbers.  Show
that finding a quadratic polynomial $q(x)$ that satisfies
$q(x_i) = A_i$ is equivalent to solving a system of three
linear equations.
\begin{hint}
   Substituting $q(x_i) = A_i$, for $i = 1,2,3$, into the standard
quadratic equation $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ yields
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
ax_1^2 & + & bx_1 & + & c & = & A_1 \\
ax_2^2 & + & bx_2 & + & c & = & A_2 \\
ax_3^2 & + & bx_3 & + & c & = & A_3\end{array}
\]
Finding the appropriate quadratic polynomial would be equivalent to
solving this system of linear equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$ in
terms of $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$.
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans The quadratic $p(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 1$ satisfies these conditions.

\soln Since $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for any quadratic equation, we find
this solution by evaluating $p(0) = 1$, $p(1) = 5$, and $p(-1) = -5$,
which yields the system of equations
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrr}
p(0) & = & & & & & c & = & 1 \\
p(1) & = & a & + & b & + & c & = & 5 \\
p(-1) & = & a & - & b & + & c & = & -5\end{array}
\]
We solve this system to obtain $(a,b,c) = (-1,5,1)$, then substitute
these coefficients into the general quadratic.

(b) Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic equation.  Then, the
assumptions $p(0) = L$, $p(1) = M$, and $p(-1) = N$ imply:
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrr}
p(0) & = & & & & & c & = & L \\
p(1) & = & a & + & b & + & c & = & M \\
p(-1) & = & a & - & b & + & c & = & N\end{array}
\]
The unique solution to this system is $(a,b,c) =
(\frac{M + N - 2L}{2},\frac{M - N}{2},L)$.

(c) Substituting $q(x_i) = A_i$, for $i = 1,2,3$, into the standard
quadratic equation $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ yields
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
ax_1^2 & + & bx_1 & + & c & = & A_1 \\
ax_2^2 & + & bx_2 & + & c & = & A_2 \\
ax_3^2 & + & bx_3 & + & c & = & A_3\end{array}
\]
Finding the appropriate quadratic polynomial would be equivalent to
solving this system of linear equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$ in
terms of $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$.

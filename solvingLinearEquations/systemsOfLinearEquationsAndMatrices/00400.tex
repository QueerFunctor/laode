sum of Dick's age and Jane's age was twice Jane's age now.  How
old are Dick and Jane?
\begin{prompt}
  Dick is $\answer{17}$ and Jane is $\answer{9}$.
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
  Rewrite the two statements
  as linear equations in $D$ --- Dick's age now --- and $J$ ---
  Jane's age now.  Then solve the system of linear equations.
\end{hint}

\begin{solution}

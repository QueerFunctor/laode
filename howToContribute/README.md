# How to Contribute

Let's learn how to add a new exercise to the textbook.

## Fork the repository

Go to https://github.com/mooculus/laode and click `Fork`

## Write your exercise

Open `[template.tex](./template.tex)`.  You will find a sample
template for creating a new exercise.

## Locate the appropriate section of the textbook

Let's suppose you would like to add an exercise to Section 2.2, The
Geoemtry of Low-Dimensional Solutions.

You will find the text for that section in [../solvingLinearEquations/theGeometryOfLowDimensionalSolutions.tex](../solvingLinearEquations/theGeometryOfLowDimensionalSolutions.tex), and a subdirectory of the same name ([../solvingLinearEquations/theGeometryOfLowDimensionalSolutions](../solvingLinearEquations/theGeometryOfLowDimensionalSolutions)) houses the exercise files.

Pick a new, unused number, and add place your exercise file in that directory.

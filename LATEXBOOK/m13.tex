\exer{c10.3.1}
(a) The eigenvalues of $A$ are $\lambda_1 = 3$ and $\lambda_2 = -3$,
with corresponding eigenvectors $v_1 = (1,1)^t$ and $v_2 = (1,-1)^t$,
respectively.

(b) Let
\[
S = (v_1|v_2) = \mattwo{1}{1}{1}{-1}.
\]
Then $D = S^{-1}AS = \mattwo{3}{0}{0}{-3}$ is a diagonal matrix.

\exer{c10.3.2}
The eigenvectors of $A$ are $v_1 = (1,1,-1)^t$ associated to eigenvalue
$\lambda_1 = 2$; $v_2 = (1,-1,-1)^t$ associated to eigenvalue
$\lambda_2 = -2$; and $v_3 = (1,-1,1)^t$ associated to eigenvalue
$\lambda_3 = -4$.  Find these vectors by solving $(A - \lambda I_3)v = 0$
for each eigenvalue $\lambda$.  The matrix $S$ such that $S^{-1}AS$ is
diagonal is
\[
S = (v_1|v_2|v_3) = \matthree{1}{1}{1}{1}{-1}{-1}{-1}{-1}{1}.
\]

\exer{c10.3.3}
The eigenvalues of $A$ are $\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_2 = -1$.  The
eigenvector associated to $\lambda_1$ is $v_1 = (1,1,1)^t$.  There are
two eigenvectors associated to $\lambda_2$: $v_2 = (1,0,0)^t$ and
$v_3 = (0,1,2)^t$.
\[
S = (v_1|v_2|v_3) = \matthree{1}{1}{0}{1}{0}{1}{1}{0}{2}.
\]

\exer{c10.3.4}
(a) Let $B = P^{-1}AP$ be a matrix similar to some invertible matrix $A$.
Then 
\[
B^{-1} = (P^{-1}AP)^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}(P^{-1})^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P.
\]
Since $A^{-1}$ exists, $B^{-1}$ exists also.

(b) If $B = P^{-1}AP$, then $B^{-1} = (P^{-1}AP)^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P$.
Therefore,
\[
B + B^{-1} = P^{-1}AP + P^{-1}A^{-1}P = P^{-1}(A + A^{-1})P
\]
since matrix multiplication is associative.  Therefore, $A + A^{-1}$ is
similar to $B + B^{-1}$.

\exer{c10.3.5}
Let $A = P^{-1}BP$ for some invertible matrix $P$, and let
$D = S^{-1}AS$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix.  Then
\[
D = S^{-1}AS = S^{-1}(P^{-1}BP)S = (S^{-1}P^{-1})B(PS) = 
(PS)^{-1}B(PS).
\]
Therefore, $B$ is also similar to $D$, so $B$ is real diagonalizable.

\exer{c10.3.6}
Let $S$ be a matrix such that $D = S^{-1}AS$ is a diagonal matrix.
Then
\[
S^{-1}(A + \alpha I_n)S = S^{-1}AS + S^{-1}(\alpha I_n)S =
D + \alpha I_n.
\]
The matrices $D$ and $\alpha I_n$ are both diagonal; so $D + \alpha I_n$
is also diagonal.  Therefore, $A + \alpha I_n$ is diagonalizable.


\exer{c10.3.6A}  We assume that $Av=\lambda v$ and that $AB=BA$.  It follows that 
$ABv=BAv=\lambda Bv$.  Therefore $Bv$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue
$\lambda$.  Since $\lambda$ has only one independent eigenvector, it follows that 
$v$ is a multiple of $v$; that is, there is a scalar $\mu$ such that $Bv=\mu v$.

\exer{c10.3.6B}  Suppose that $BA=AB$ and that the eigenvalues of $A$ are distinct. 
By Theorem~\ref{T:diagsimple} and Lemma~\ref{L:eigenv-diag}, 
there is a basis $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ of $\R^n$ consisting of eigenvectors of $A$.  By 
Exercise~\ref{c10.3.6A}, these vectors are also eigenvectors of $B$.  Let 
$S=(v_1|\cdots|v_n)$.  Then both matrices $S\inv AS$ and $S\inv BS$ are diagonal 
matrices.

\exer{c10.3.6C} Since $A$ is diagonalizable, there is an invertible matrix $S$ such 
that $S\inv AS$ is diagonal.  The diagonal entries of  $S\inv AS$ are the eigenvalues
of $A$; that is, the diagonal entries equal $\pm 1$.  Therefore, $(S\inv AS)^2=I_n$.
But $(S\inv AS)^2 = S\inv A^2 S$.   Therefore, $S\inv A^2 S=I_n$ which implies that
$A^2=I_n$.

\exer{c10.3.6D}  Since $A$ is diagonalizable, there is an invertible matrix $S$ such 
that $S\inv AS$ is diagonal.  The diagonal entries of  $S\inv AS$ are the eigenvalues
of $A$; that is, the diagonal entries equal $0$ and $1$.  Therefore, 
$(S\inv AS)^2=S\inv AS$.  But $(S\inv AS)^2 = S\inv A^2 S$.   Therefore, 
$S\inv A^2 S= S\inv AS$ which implies that $A^2=A$.

\exer{c10.3.7}
Verify that the eigenvalues of $C$ are real and distinct using the
\Matlab command {\tt eig(C)}, which yields:
\begin{verbatim}
ans =
   -4.0000
  -12.0000
   -8.0000
  -16.0000
\end{verbatim}
In order to find the matrix $S$, either use the {\tt null} command to
find the eigenvectors of $C$ individually, or type
{\tt [S,D] = eig(C)} to obtain the matrix $S$ and the diagonal matrix
$D = S^{-1}CS$:
\begin{verbatim}
S =
    0.5314   -0.5547    0.0000    0.4082
   -0.4871    0.5547   -0.4082   -0.8165
    0.6199   -0.5547    0.8165    0.4082
   -0.3100    0.2774   -0.4082    0.0000

D =
   -4.0000         0         0         0
         0  -12.0000         0         0
         0         0   -8.0000         0
         0         0         0  -16.0000
\end{verbatim}

\exer{c10.3.8a}
\ans Matrix $A$ is real diagonalizable.

\soln Compute the eigenvalues of $A$ using \Matlabp.  By
Theorem~\ref{T:diagsimple}, a matrix is real diagonalizable if it has
real distinct eigenvalues.  Thus, $A$ is real diagonalizable.

\exer{c10.3.8b}
\ans Matrix $B$ is not real diagonalizable.

\soln Compute the eigenvalues of $B$ using \Matlabp.  If a matrix is
real diagonalizable, it has real eigenvalues.  Matrix $B$ has complex
eigenvectors, and is therefore not real diagonalizable.


\subsection*{Section~\protect{\ref{S:CSE}} Complex Simple Eigenvalues}
\rhead{S:CSE}{COMPLEX SIMPLE EIGENVALUES}

\exer{c10.4.3} 
\ans
\[
T = \cmattwo{1 - i}{1 + i}{2i}{-2i}
\AND S = \mattwo{1}{-1}{0}{2}.
\]

\soln $T$ is the matrix whose columns are the complex eigenvectors
of $A$.  Multiplying $T^{-1}AT$ yields
\[
\cmattwo{2 + i}{0}{0}{2 - i},
\]
the matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$ along the main diagonal.  The
first column of the matrix $S$ contains the real part of the eigenvector
$(1 + i, -2i)^t$, and the second column contains the imaginary part of
this eigenvector. Multiplying $S^{-1}AS$ yields
\[
\cmattwo{2}{-1}{1}{2} = \mattwo{\sigma}{-\tau}{\tau}{\sigma}
\]
where $\sigma - i\tau$ is the eigenvalue $2 - i$ associated to
eigenvector $(1 + i, -2i)^t$.

\exer{c10.4.4}
\ans $T = \mattwoc{5}{5}{-1+3i}{-1-3i}$ and $S=\mattwoc{5}{-1}{0}{3}$ 

\soln The eigenvalues of $A$ are $1\pm 3i$ and the associated eigenvectors 
are $(5,-1\pm 3i)^t$.  The columns of $T$ are just the eigenvectors of $A$
and the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors are the columns of $S$. 


\exer{c10.4.rotate}
Matrix $A$ rotates a vector by $45^{\circ}$ counterclockwise, then expands
the vector by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.  Let $v_1 = Av_0$, $v_2 =
Av_1$, and so on.  Note that $v_8 = 16v_0$.  That is, after eight
iterations, the vector points in its original direction and has length
$16|v_0|$.

\para Let $w_1 = Bv_0$ and $w_2 = Bw_1$.  Then, $w_8 = 16v_0
= v_8$.  The rotation and dilatation caused by matrix $B$ coincides
with that of matrix $A$ every 8 iterations, or $360^\circ$.  However,
$B$ does not cause a single constant rotation or dilatation on each
iteration, as does $A$.

\exer{c10.4.6}
(a) Enter the matrix in \Matlabp, then type {\tt [S,D] = eig(A)} to
find the eigenvectors 
S =
 
   0.8165             0.8165
  -0.4082 - 0.4083i  -0.4082 + 0.4083i

$v_1 = (0.8165, -0.4082 - 0.4083i)^t$ and
$v_2 = (0.8165, -0.4082 + 0.4083i)^t$ with eigenvalues
$\lambda_1 = 0.1559 + 0.9878i$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.1559 - 0.9878i$.

(b) The real block diagonal normal form of $A$ is
\[
R = \mattwo{\sigma}{-\tau}{\tau}{\sigma} = \mattwo{0.1559}{-0.9878}
{0.9878}{0.1559}
\]
where $\lambda_1 = \sigma + i\tau$.  Note that $|\lambda_j|=1$.  
This matrix rotates a vector through an angle of 
$\cos^{-1}(0.1559) \approx \sqrt{2}$, and does not alter its length.  

\newpage
(c) In this case, the matrix rotates and dilatates the vector so that
the endpoints of the iterated vectors lie on an ellipse.

\soln The matrix $T$ is the matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of $A$. 
Find $T$ in \Matlab by typing {\tt [T,D] = eig(A)}.  The second and third columns
of $S$ correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the second eigenvector
of $A$.  Verify these solutions by noting that
{\tt inv(T)*A*T} yields a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$
along the diagonal, and that {\tt inv(S)*A*S} yields a block matrix
with blocks consisting of the real and imaginary parts of each complex

\exer{c10.5.2C} \ans There are $6$ possible Jordan normal form matrices which are
determined by computing nullity$(A-2I_8)$ and nullity$(A-(1+i)I_8)$.

\soln  Since $A$ is real, the eigenvalues of $A$ are $2$ with multiplicity three; 
$1+i$ with multiplicity two; $1-i$ with multiplicity two; and $0$ with multiplicity 
$1$.  There are three possible Jordan blocks associated with the eigenvalues $2$
determined by the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue $2$ and two possible Jordan
blocks associated with the eigenvalues $1\pm i$ determined by the geometric

\cmatthree{e^t}{0}{0}{0}{e^{-t}}{te^{-t}}{0}{0}{e^{-t}}$.

\soln The matrix $J$ is in block diagonal form so we can compute the matrix exponential 
by computing the matrix exponential of each block.  In particular, let 
\[
M = \mattwo{-1}{1}{0}{-1}.
\]
Then 
\[
e^{tM} = e^{-t}(I_2+tM) = e^{-t}\mattwo{1}{t}{0}{1}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
e^{tJ} = \mattwo{e^t}{0}{0}{e^{tM}} = 
\cmatthree{e^t}{0}{0}{0}{e^{-t}}{te^{-t}}{0}{0}{e^{-t}}.

\soln  The matrix $J$ has block diagonal form 
\[

\]
where
\[
L = \mattwo{2}{1}{0}{2} \AND M = \matthree{3}{1}{0}{0}{3}{1}{0}{0}{3}.
\]
Therefore,
\[

\]
where
\[
e^L = e^{2t}\mattwo{1}{t}{0}{1} \AND

(a) The linear map $N^2$ satisfies
\[
N^2e_1 = N^2e_2 = 0, \AND N^2e_j = e_{j - 2}
\mbox{ for } j = 3,\ldots,n.
\]
The linear map $N^3$ satisfies
\[
N^3e_1 = N^3e_2 = N^3e_3 = 0, \AND N^3e_j = e_{j - 3} \mbox{ for }
j = 4,\ldots,n.
\]
By induction, $N^ne_j = 0$ for $j = 1,\dots,n$.  So $N^n = 0$, and $N$
is nilpotent.

(b) Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of matrix $N$.  Then, there
exists a nonzero vector $v$ such that $Nv = \lambda v$.  Therefore,
$N^nv = \lambda^nv$.  If $N$ is nilpotent, then $\lambda^nv = 0$.  Since
$v$ is nonzero, $\lambda^n = 0$, which implies $\lambda = 0$.

(c) Let $M = P^{-1}NP$ be a matrix similar to nilpotent $n \times n$
matrix $N$.  Then $M^n = (P^{-1}NP)^n = P^{-1}N^nP$.  Since $N$ is
nilpotent, $N^n = 0$.  So $M^n = 0$, and $M$ is also nilpotent.

(d) By the Jordan normal form theorem, $N$ is similar to some matrix $W$ which
is block diagonal and has the matrices $N_j$ along the diagonal, where each
$N_j$ is a Jordan block.  By (a) of this problem, $N_j^n = 0$ for each
$j$.  $W^n$ is block diagonal with blocks $N_j^n$.  Since $N_j^n = 0$ for all
$j$, $W^n = 0$.  Thus, $W$ is nilpotent, and, by (c) of this problem, $N$
is also nilpotent.

\exer{c10.5.5C}
The characteristic polynomial of a $3\times 3$ matrix $A$ has the form 
\[
p_A(\lambda) = -\lambda^3 + b_2\lambda^2 + b_1\lambda + b_0.
\]
The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that 
\[
p_A(A) = -A^3 + b_2A^2 + b_1A + b_0I_3 = 0.
\]
Therefore
\[
A(-A^2 +b_2A +b_1I_3) = -b_0I_3.
\]
Since $p_A(\lambda) =\det(A-\lambda I_3)$, it follows that $b_0=p_A(0)=\det(A)$.
Since $A$ is invertible, $\det(A)\neq 0$; that is, $b_0\neq 0$.  Finally, 
\[
A\inv = -\frac{1}{b_0}(-A^2+b_2A+b_1I_3) = aI_3 + bA + cA^2,
\]
where $a = -b_1/b_0$, $b = -b_2/b_0$, and $c=1/b_0$.

an eigenvalue at $-1$ with algebraic multiplicity 3 and one linearly

and label it $v_{23}$.  Set $v_{22} = (A + I_4)v_{23}$ and

\soln
Type {\tt eig(A)} to find that $-2$ is the only eigenvalues of $A$.  Then 
type {\tt null(A + 2*eye(4))} to find the number of linearly
independent eigenvectors associated to eigenvalue $\lambda = -2$.  
The eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity $4$ and geometric multiplicity
$2$.  We then find that the nullity of $(A + 2I_4)^2$ is $4$. 
Therefore, all generalized eigenvectors $v$ of $D$ are in the null space

case $v_{12} = (1,0,0,0)^t$ and $v_{22} = (0,1,0,0)^t$, and set
$v_{11} = (A + 2I_4)v_{12}$ and $v_{21} = (A + 2I_4)v_{22}$.  Then,

\soln To find $S$, use \Matlab to see that $A$ has two eigenvalues: $-1$ of
algebraic multiplicity three and $2$ of multiplicity one.  The geometric 
multiplicity of $-1$ is one.  Just type {\tt null(A+eye(4))} to see that 
$(1,1,1,1)$ is the only eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.  Choose 
{\tt v3} in the null space of $(A+I_4)^3$ but not in the null space of

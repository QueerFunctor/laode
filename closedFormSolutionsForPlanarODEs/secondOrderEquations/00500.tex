\begin{exercise} \label{c6.7.3}
Prove that a nonzero solution to a second order linear differential equation
with constant coefficients cannot be identically equal to zero on a nonempty
interval.

\begin{solution}

Suppose $x(t) = 0$ for all $t \in [a,b]$.  Then there exists a 
$c \in [a,b]$ such that $x(c) = 0$ and $\dot{x}(c) = 0$, since $x(c) =
0 = x(c + \epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon$.  According to the differential
equation for $x$, $\ddot{x}(c) = 0$.  Thus $x$ is identically $0$.

\end{solution}

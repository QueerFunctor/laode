\begin{exercise} \label{c6.7.2}
By direct integration solve the differential equation \eqref{e:pointpart}
for a point particle moving only under the influence of gravity.  Show
that the solution is
\[
x(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + x_0
\]
where $x_0$ is the initial position of the particle and $v_0$ is the initial
velocity.

\begin{solution}

By \eqref{e:pointpart}, a point particle moving only under the influence of
gravity has a position $x(t)$ governed by
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + g = 0, \quad \mbox{ or } \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -g.
\]
Integrate this formula to obtain $\frac{dx}{dt} = -gt + C_1$.  In this case
$\frac{dx}{dt}(t)$ is the velocity of the particle at time $t$, so the
constant $C_1 = v_0$, the initial velocity of the particle.  Integrate
$\frac{dx}{dt} = -gt + v_0$ to obtain
$x = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + C_2$.  In this case, $C_2 = x_0$ the position
of the particle at time $t_0$.  Thus,
\[
x = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + x_0.
\]

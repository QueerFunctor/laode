In Exercises~\ref{c6.6.2a} -- \ref{c6.6.2d} compute the general solution for
the given system of differential equations.
\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.6.2a}
$\dps\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{-1}{-4}{2}{3} X$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The general solution to the differential equation is
\[
X(t) =
\alpha_1\cvectwo{2e^t\cos(2t)}{e^t(\sin(2t) - \cos(2t))} +
\alpha_2\cvectwo{2e^t\sin(2t)}{-e^t(\sin(2t) + \cos(2t))}.
\]

\soln First, find the eigenvalues of $C$, which are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial
\[
p_C(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 5.
\]
The eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 1 + 2i$ and $\lambda_2 = 1 - 2i$.  Then,
find the eigenvector associated to $\lambda_1$ by solving the equation
\[
(C - \lambda_1I_2)v_1 =
\left(\mattwo{-1}{-4}{2}{3} - \cmattwo{1 + 2i}{0}{0}{1 + 2i}\right)v_1
= \cmattwo{-2 - 2i}{-4}{2}{2 - 2i}v_1 = 0.
\]
Solve this equation to find that
\[
v_1 = \cvectwo{2}{-1 - i} = \vectwo{2}{-1} + i\vectwo{0}{-1}
\]
is an eigenvector of $C$.  Since the eigenvalues of $C$ are complex, we
can find the general solution using \eqref{E:CC1} and \eqref{E:CC2}.  In this
case, since $\lambda_1 = 1 + 2i$ is an eigenvalue, let $\sigma = 1$ and
let $\tau = 2$.  Then $v_1 = v + iw$, where $v = (2,-1)^t$ and
$w = (0,-1)^t$.  By \eqref{E:CC1},
\[
X_1(t) = e^{\sigma t}(\cos(\tau t)v - \sin(\tau t)w) \AND
X_2(t) = e^{\sigma t}(\sin(\tau t)v + \cos(\tau t)w)
\]
are solutions to the differential equation.  In this case,
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
X_1(t) & = & e^t\left(\cos(2t)\vectwo{2}{-1} -
\sin(2t)\vectwo{0}{-1}\right)
= e^t\cvectwo{2\cos(2t)}{\sin(2t) - \cos(2t)}. \\
X_2(t) & = & e^t\left(\sin(2t)\vectwo{2}{-1} +
\cos(2t)\vectwo{0}{-1}\right)
= e^t\cvectwo{2\sin(2t)}{-\sin(2t) - \cos(2t)}.
\end{array}
\]
The general solution consists of all linear combinations
$X(t) = \alpha_1X_1(t) + \alpha_2X_2(t)$.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.6.2b}
$\dps\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{8}{-15}{3}{-4} X$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The general solution to the differential equation is
\[
X(t) =
\alpha_1\cvectwo{5e^{2t}\cos(3t)}{e^{2t}(2\cos(3t) + \sin(3t))} +
\alpha_2\cvectwo{5e^{2t}\sin(3t)}{e^{2t}(2\sin(3t) - \cos(3t))}.
\]

\soln First, find the eigenvalues of $C$, which are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial
\[
p_C(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 13.
\]
The eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 2 + 3i$ and $\lambda_2 = 2 - 3i$.  Then,
find the eigenvector associated to $\lambda_1$ by solving the equation
\[
(C - \lambda_1I_2)v_1 =
\left(\mattwo{8}{-15}{3}{-4} - \cmattwo{2 + 3i}{0}{0}{2 + 3i}\right)v_1
= \cmattwo{6 - 3i}{-15}{3}{-6 - 3i}v_1 = 0.
\]
Solve this equation to find that
\[
v_1 = \cvectwo{5}{2 - i} = \vectwo{5}{2} + i\vectwo{0}{-1}
\]
is an eigenvector of $C$.  Since the eigenvalues of $C$ are complex, we
can find the general solution using \eqref{E:CC1} and \eqref{E:CC2}.  In this
case, since $\lambda_1 = 2 + 3i$ is
an eigenvalue, let $\sigma = 2$ and let $\tau = 3$.  Then $v_1 = v + iw$,
where $v = (5,2)^t$ and $w = (0,-1)^t$.  By \eqref{E:CC1},
\[
X_1(t) = e^{\sigma t}(\cos(\tau t)v - \sin(\tau t)w) \AND
X_2(t) = e^{\sigma t}(\sin(\tau t)v + \cos(\tau t)w)
\]
are solutions to the differential equation.  In this case,
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
X_1(t) & = & e^{2t}\left(\cos(3t)\vectwo{5}{2} -
\sin(3t)\vectwo{0}{-1}\right)
= e^{2t}\cvectwo{5\cos(3t)}{\sin(3t) + 2\cos(3t)}. \\
X_2(t) & = & e^{2t}\left(\sin(3t)\vectwo{5}{2} +
\cos(3t)\vectwo{0}{-1}\right)
= e^{2t}\cvectwo{5\sin(3t)}{2\sin(3t) - \cos(3t)}.
\end{array}
\]
The general solution consists of all linear combinations
$X(t) = \alpha_1X_1(t) + \alpha_2X_2(t)$.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.6.2c}
$\dps\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{5}{-1}{1}{3} X$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The general solution to the differential equation is
\[
X(t) = e^{4t}\Matrixc{ 1+ t & -t \\ t & 1-t} X_0
\]
where $X_0$ is the initial condition.

\soln First, find the eigenvalues of $C$, which are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial
\[
p_C(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 4)^2.
\]
Thus, $C$ has a double eigenvalue at $\lambda_1 = 4$.  Solve the system 
by using formula \eqref{e:exp1eva}.  Compute 
\[
C - 4I_2 =  \Matrix{1 & -1 \\ 1 & -1}
\]
Hence 
\[
X(t) = e^{4t}\left(I_2 + t \Matrix{1 & -1 \\ 1 & -1}\right) = e^{4t}\Matrixc{ 1+t & -t \\ t & 1-t} X_0 
\]
where $X_0$ is the initial condition.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.6.2d}
$\dps\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{-4}{4}{-1}{0} X$.

\begin{solution}
\ans The general solution to the differential equation is
\[
X(t) = \alpha e^{-2t}\cvectwo{2}{1} + \beta e^{-2t}\cvectwo{2t + 1}{t + 1}.
\]

\soln First, find the eigenvalues of $C$, which are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial
\[
p_C(\lambda) = \lambda^2 + 4\lambda + 4 = (\lambda + 2)^2.
\]
Thus, $C$ has a double eigenvalue at $\lambda_1 = -2$.  Since $C$ is not
a multiple of $I_2$, $C$ has only one linearly independent eigenvector.
Find this eigenvector by solving the equation
\[
(C - \lambda_1I_2)v_1 = \left(\mattwo{-4}{4}{-1}{0} + \mattwo{2}{0}{0}{2}
\right)v_1 = \mattwo{-2}{4}{-1}{2}v_1 = 0,
\]
obtaining $v_1 = (2,1)^t$.  Find the generalized eigenvector $w_1$ by
solving the equation $(C - \lambda_1 I_2)w_1 = v_1$, that is,
\[
\mattwo{-2}{4}{-1}{2}w_1 = \vectwo{2}{1}.
\]
So $w_1 = (1,1)^t$ is the generalized eigenvector.
Now, by \eqref{e:exp1eva}, we know that the
general solution to $\dot{X} = CX$ when $C$ has equal eigenvalues and only
one independent eigenvector is
\[
X(t) = e^{\lambda_1 t}(\alpha v_1 + \beta(w_1 + tv_1)).
\]
In this case,
\[
X(t) = e^{-2t}\left(\alpha \vectwo{2}{1} + \beta\left(\vectwo{1}{1} +
t\vectwo{2}{1}\right)\right).
\]

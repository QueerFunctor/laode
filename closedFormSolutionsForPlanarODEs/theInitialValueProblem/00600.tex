\begin{exercise}  \label{c6.1.4A}
Show that for some nonzero $a$ the function $x(t)=at^5$ is a solution to the
differential equation $\dot{x}=x^{4/5}$.  Then show that there are at least
two solutions to the initial value problem $x(0)=0$ for this differential
equation.

\begin{solution}
\ans If $a = \frac{1}{3125}$, then $x(t) = at^5$ is a solution
to the differential equation.  The zero function $x(t) = 0$ is also a
solution.

\soln To find out whether $x(t) = at^5$ is a solution to
$\dot{x} = x^{4/5}$, first substitute $x(t)$ into the left hand side of
the differential equation:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(at^5) = 5at^4.
\]
Then substitute $x(t)$ into the right hand side of the equation
\[
x^{4/5} = (at^5)^{4/5} = a^{4/5}t^4.
\]
Thus, $x(t)$ is a solution when $5at^4 = a^{4/5}t^4$.  Solve the equation
$5a = a^{4/5}$ for $a$ to find that $x(t)$ is a solution when $a = 5^{-5}
= \frac{1}{3125}$ or when $a = 0$.  Thus, there are at least two solutions
to the differential equation: $x(t) = \frac{1}{3125}t^4$ and $x(t) = 0$.

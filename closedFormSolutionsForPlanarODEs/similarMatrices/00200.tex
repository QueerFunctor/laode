Suppose that the matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar and the matrices
$B$ and $C$ are similar.  Show that $A$ and $C$ are also similar
matrices.

\begin{solution}

Since $A$ and $B$ are similar and $B$ and $C$ are similar,
$A = P^{-1}BP$ for some matrix $P$, and $B = Q^{-1}BQ$
for some matrix $Q$.  Therefore,
\[ A = P^{-1}BP = P^{-1}Q^{-1}CQP. \]
By Proposition~\ref{P:invprod}, $(QP)^{-1} = P^{-1}Q^{-1}$, so
\[ A = (QP)^{-1}C(QP) \]
thus, $A$ and $C$ are similar.

\end{solution}

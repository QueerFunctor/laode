In this chapter we describe two methods to find closed form
solutions to planar constant coefficient systems of linear differential
equations.  In Section~\ref{S:6.1} we begin by by showing how uniqueness to
initial value problems implies that the space of solutions to a constant
coefficient system of $n$ linear differential equations is $n$ dimensional.
Using this observation we present a direct method for solving planar linear
systems in Section~\ref{S:TDM}.  This method extends the discussion of
solutions to systems whose coefficient matrices have distinct real
eigenvalues given in Section~\ref{S:IVPR} to the cases of complex
eigenvalues and equal real eigenvalues.

The second method for finding solutions is to use changes of coordinates to 
make the coefficient matrix of the differential equation as simple as possible.  
This idea leads to the notion of {\em similarity\/} of matrices, which is discussed 
in Section~\ref{S:6.5}, and leads to the second method for solving planar linear 
systems. Both the direct method and the method based on similarity require 
being able to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix.

Similarity also leads to the Jordan Normal Form theorem for 
$2\times 2$ matrices in Section~\ref{S:6.5} and then to a proof of the Cayley 
Hamilton theorem for all $2\times 2$ matrices in Section~\ref{S:6.6}.

In Section~\ref{S:6.7} we explore qualitative features of phase portraits for planar 
linear systems of differential equations using similarity.  We find that the 
qualitative theory is determined by the eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix --- which is not surprising given
that we can classify matrices up to similarity by just knowing their
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Specifically we discuss {\em saddles\/},
{\em sinks\/} and {\em sources\/} and asymptotic stability.  This discussion also 
depends on similarity and Jordan Normal Form.

There is a third very elegant way, using matrix exponentials, to derive closed 
form solutions to $n$-dimensional linear ODE systems.  This method is described 
in Section~\ref{S:Matrixexp} and leads to a proof of uniqueness of solutions to initial value 
problems for linear systems.  See Theorem~\ref{T:linODEsoln}. 


In the last section of this chapter, Section~\ref{S:SOE}, we consider
solutions to second order equations by reduction to first order systems.

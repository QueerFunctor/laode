In this chapter we describe two methods to find closed form
solutions to planar constant coefficient systems of linear differential
equations.  In Section~\ref{S:6.1} we begin by by showing how uniqueness to
initial value problems implies that the space of solutions to a constant
coefficient system of $n$ linear differential equations is $n$ dimensional.
Using this observation we present a direct method for solving planar linear
systems in Section~\ref{S:TDM}.  This method extends the discussion of
solutions to systems whose coefficient matrices have distinct real
eigenvalues given in Section~\ref{S:IVPR} to the cases of complex
eigenvalues and equal real eigenvalues.

The matrix exponential is an elementary function that allows us to solve
all initial value problems for constant coefficient linear systems, and
this function is introduced in Section~\ref{S:Matrixexp}.  In
Section~\ref{S:LNFPS} we compute the matrix exponential for several
special, but important, examples, the Jordan normal form matrices.

The computation of matrix exponentials is
based on changes of coordinates.  The idea is to make the coefficient matrix
of the differential equation as simple as possible; indeed we put the
coefficient matrix in the form of one of the matrices whose exponential is
computed in Section~\ref{S:LNFPS}.  This idea leads to the notion of
{\em similarity\/} of matrices, which is discussed in Section~\ref{S:6.5}, and
leads to the second method for solving planar linear systems. Both the direct
method and the method based on similarity require being able to compute the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix.

Similarity also leads to a proof of the Jordan Normal Form theorem for 
$2\times 2$ matrices in Section~\ref{S:6.5} and then to a proof of the Cayley 
Hamilton theorem for all $2\times 2$ matrices in Section~\ref{S:6.6}.

In the last section of this chapter, Section~\ref{S:SOE}, we consider
solutions to second order equations by reduction to first order systems.

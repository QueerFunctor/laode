In this appendix we use the Jordan normal form theorem to study the asymptotic
dynamics of transition matrices\index{matrix!transition} such as those of 
Markov chains\index{Markov chain} introduced in 
Section~\ref{S:TransitionApplied}.

The basic result is the following theorem.
\begin{theorem} \label{T:convergeto0}
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and assume that all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of 
$A$ satisfy $|\lambda|<1$.  Then for every vector $v_0\in\R^n$
\begin{equation}  \label{E:convergeto0}
\lim_{k\to\infty} A^kv_0 = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}  Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are similar matrices; that is, $B=SAS\inv$
for some invertible matrix $S$.  Then $B^k = SA^kS\inv$ and for any vector 
$v_0\in\R^n$ \eqref{E:convergeto0} is valid if and only if
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty} B^kv_0 = 0.
\]
Thus, when proving this theorem, we may assume that $A$ is in Jordan normal
form.

Suppose that $A$ is in block diagonal form; that is, suppose
\[
A=\mattwo{C}{0}{0}{D},
\]
where $C$ is an $\ell\times\ell$ matrix and $D$ is a $(n-\ell)\times (n-\ell)$
matrix.  Then 
\[
A^k = \mattwo{C^k}{0}{0}{D^k}.
\]
So for every vector $v_0=(w_0,u_0)\in\R^\ell\times\R^{n-\ell}$ 
\eqref{E:convergeto0} is valid if and only if 
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty} C^kv_0 = 0 \AND \lim_{k\to\infty} D^kv_0 = 0.
\]
So, when proving this theorem, we may assume that $A$ is a Jordan block.

Consider the case of a simple Jordan block\index{Jordan block}.  
Suppose that $n=1$ and that 
$A=(\lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is either real or complex.  Then 
\[
A^kv_0 = \lambda^kv_0.
\]
It follows that \eqref{E:convergeto0} is valid precisely when $|\lambda|<1$.  
Next, suppose that $A$ is a nontrivial Jordan block.  For example, let 
\[
A=\mattwo{\lambda}{1}{0}{\lambda} = \lambda I_2+N
\]
where $N^2=0$.  It follows by induction that 
\[
A^kv_0 = \lambda^kv_0 + k\lambda^{k-1}Nv_0 = \lambda^kv_0 + 
k\lambda^k\frac{1}{\lambda}Nv_0.
\]
Thus \eqref{E:convergeto0} is valid precisely when $|\lambda|<1$.  The reason for this convergence is as follows.  The first term converges to $0$ as 
before but the second term is the product of three terms $k$, $\lambda^k$,
and $\frac{1}{\lambda}Nv_0$.  The first increases to infinity, the second
decreases to zero, and the third is constant independent of $k$.  In fact,
geometric decay\index{geometric decay} 
($\lambda^k$, when $|\lambda|<1$) always beats 
polynomial growth\index{polynomial growth}.  Indeed,
\begin{equation}  \label{E:PG}
\lim_{m\to\infty}m^j\lambda^m = 0
\end{equation}
for any integer $j$.  This fact can be proved using l'H\^{o}spital's rule 
and induction.

So we see that when $A$ has a nontrivial Jordan block, convergence is 
subtler than when $A$ has only simple Jordan blocks, as initially the 
vectors $Av_0$ grow in magnitude.  For example, suppose that $\lambda=0.75$ 
and $v_0=(1,0)^t$.  Then $A^8v_0 = (0.901,0.075)^t$ is the first vector in 
the sequence $A^kv_0$ whose norm is less than $1$; that is, $A^8v_0$ is the 
first vector in the sequence closer to the origin than $v_0$.  

It is also true that \eqref{E:convergeto0} is valid for any Jordan block 
$A$ and for all $v_0$ precisely when $|\lambda|<1$.  To verify this fact 
we use the binomial theorem\index{binomial theorem}.  
We can write a nontrivial Jordan block as
$\lambda I_n+N$ where $N^{k+1}=0$ for some integer $k$.  We just discussed 
the case $k=1$.  In this case
\begin{align*}
(\lambda I_n+N)^m &= \lambda^mI_n+m\lambda^{m-1}N + 
\left(\begin{array}{@{}c@{}} m\\2\end{array}\right)\lambda^{m-2}N^2
  +\cdots \\
  &\quad + 
\left(\begin{array}{@{}c@{}} m\\k \end{array}\right)\lambda^{m-k}N^k,
\end{align*}
where
\[
\left(\begin{array}{@{}c@{}} m \\ j\end{array}\right)
 = \frac{m!}{j!(m-j)!}=\frac{m(m-1)\cdots(m-j+1)}{j!}.
\]
To verify that 
\[
\lim_{m\to\infty}(\lambda I_n+N)^m = 0
\]
we need only verify that each term
\[
\lim_{m\to\infty}\left(\begin{array}{@{}c@{}} m\\j \end{array}\right)
\lambda^{m-j}N^j = 0
\]
Such terms are the product of three terms 
\[
m(m-1)\cdots(m-j+1) \AND \lambda^m \AND \frac{1}{j!\lambda^j}N^j.
\]
The first term has polynomial growth to infinity dominated by $m^j$, the 
second term decreases to zero geometrically, and the third term is 
constant independent of $m$. The desired convergence to zero follows from 
\eqref{E:PG}.  \end{proof}

\begin{definition}  The $n\times n$ matrix $A$ has a {\em dominant\/} eigenvalue 
$\lambda_0>0$ if $\lambda_0$ is a simple eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues
$\lambda$ of $A$ satisfy $|\lambda|<\lambda_0$.
\end{definition}\index{eigenvalue!dominant}


\begin{theorem}  \label{T:Markovdom}
Let $P$ be a Markov matrix. Then $1$ is a dominant eigenvalue of $P$.
\end{theorem}\index{matrix!Markov}\index{matrix!Markov}

\begin{proof}  Recall from Chapter~\ref{chap:matrices}, Definition~\ref{D:Markov} 
that a Markov matrix is a square matrix $P$ whose entries are nonnegative, 
whose rows sum to $1$, and for which a power $P^k$ that has all positive 
entries.  To prove this theorem we must show that all eigenvalues $\lambda$ 
of $P$ satisfy $|\lambda|\leq 1$ and that $1$ is a simple eigenvalue of $P$.

Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $P$ and let $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)^t$ be an 
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$.  We prove that 
$|\lambda|\leq 1$.  Choose $j$ so that $|v_j|\ge|v_i|$ for all $i$.  Since 
$Pv=\lambda v$, we can equate the $j^{th}$ coordinates of both sides of 
this equality, obtaining
\[
p_{j1}v_1 + \cdots + p_{jn}v_n = \lambda v_j.
\]
Therefore,
\[
 |\lambda| |v_j| = |p_{j1}v_1 + \cdots + p_{jn}v_n| \leq 
p_{j1}|v_1| + \cdots + p_{jn}|v_n|,
\]
since the $p_{ij}$ are nonnegative.  It follows that 
\[
|\lambda| |v_j| \leq (p_{j1}+\cdots+p_{jn})|v_j| =|v_j|,
\]
since $|v_i|\le|v_j|$ and rows of $P$ sum to $1$.  Since $|v_j|>0$, it 
follows that $\lambda\leq 1$.

Next we show that $1$ is a simple eigenvalue of $P$.  Recall, or just 
calculate directly, that the vector $(1,\ldots,1)^t$ is an eigenvector of $P$ 
with eigenvalue $1$.  Now let $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)^t$ be an eigenvector of $P$ 
with eigenvalue $1$.  Let $Q=P^k$ so that all entries of $Q$ are positive. 
Observe that $v$ is an eigenvector of $Q$ with eigenvalue $1$, and hence that 
all rows of $Q$ also sum to $1$.

To show that $1$ is a simple eigenvalue of $Q$, and therefore of $P$, we must 
show that all coordinates of $v$ are equal.  Using the previous estimates 
(with $\lambda=1$), we obtain 
\begin{equation}  \label{E:ineqM}
|v_j|= |q_{j1}v_1 + \cdots + q_{jn}v_n| \leq  q_{j1}|v_1| + \cdots + 
q_{jn}|v_n| \leq |v_j|.
\end{equation}
Hence 
\[
|q_{j1}v_1 + \cdots + q_{jn}v_n| =  q_{j1}|v_1| + \cdots + q_{jn}|v_n|.
\]
This equality is valid only if all of the $v_i$ are nonnegative or all are 
nonpositive.  Without loss of generality, we assume that all $v_i\geq 0$.
It follows from \eqref{E:ineqM} that 
\[
v_j= q_{j1}v_1 + \cdots + q_{jn}v_n.
\]
Since $q_{ji}>0$, this inequality can hold only if all of the $v_i$ are
equal.  \end{proof}


\begin{theorem} \label{T:convergetoeig}
(a)  Let $Q$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with dominant eigenvalue 
$\lambda>0$ and associated eigenvector $v$.  Let $v_0$ be any vector in 
$\R^n$.  Then
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{1}{\lambda^k}Q^kv_0 = cv,
\]
for some scalar $c$.

(b)  Let $P$ be a Markov matrix and $v_0$ a nonzero vector in $\R^n$
with all entries nonnegative.  Then 
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty}(P^t)^kv_0 = V
\]
where $V$ is the eigenvector of $P^t$ with eigenvalue $1$ such that the 
sum of the entries in $V$ is equal to the sum of the entries in $v_0$.
\end{theorem} \index{matrix!Markov}\index{matrix!Markov}

\begin{proof}  (a) After a similarity transformation, if needed, 
we can assume that $Q$ is in 
Jordan normal form.  More precisely, we can assume that 
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda}Q = \mattwo{1}{0}{0}{A}
\]
where $A$ is an $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ matrix with all eigenvalues $\mu$
satisfying $|\mu|<1$.  Suppose $v_0=(c_0,w_0)\in\R\times\R^{n-1}$.  It 
follows from Theorem~\ref{T:convergeto0} that 
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{1}{\lambda^k}Q^kv_0 = 
\lim_{k\to\infty}(\frac{1}{\lambda}Q)^kv_0 =
\lim_{k\to\infty}\mattwo{c_0}{0}{0}{A^kw_0} = c_0e_1.
\]
Since $e_1$ is the eigenvector of $Q$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$ Part (a) 
is proved.

(b)   Theorem~\ref{T:Markovdom} states that a Markov matrix has a dominant 
eigenvalue equal to $1$.  The Jordan normal form theorem implies that the 
eigenvalues of $P^t$ are equal to the eigenvalues of $P$ with the same 
algebraic and geometric multiplicities.  It follows that $1$ is also a 
dominant eigenvalue of $P^t$.  It follows from Part (a) that
\[
\lim_{k\to\infty}(P^t)^kv_0 = cV
\]
for some scalar $c$.  But Theorem~\ref{T:Markov} in 
Chapter~\ref{chap:matrices} implies that the sum of the
entries in $v_0$ equals the sum of the entries in $cV$ which, by assumption
equals the sum of the entries in $V$.  Thus, $c=1$.   \end{proof}

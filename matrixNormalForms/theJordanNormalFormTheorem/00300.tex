How many different $6\times 6$ Jordan form matrices have all eigenvalues 
equal to $3$? (We say that two Jordan form matrices are the same 
if they have the same number and type of Jordan block, though not
necessarily in the same order along the diagonal.)

\begin{solution}
\ans There are $10$ different Jordan normal form matrices.

\soln  There is $1$ matrix with six Jordan blocks.  There is $1$ matrix with five
Jordan blocks.  There are $2$ matrices with four Jordan blocks; one matrix has a
Jordan block of size three and three blocks of size one and the other matrix has two
Jordan blocks of size two and two of size one.  There are $2$ matrices with three
Jordan blocks; one has a block of size four and one has three blocks of size two.
There are $3$ matrices with two Jordan blocks; one matrix each with a block of
size $n$, where $n=1,2,3$.  There is $1$ Jordan matrix with one Jordan block. 
Altogether, there are $10$ different matrices.

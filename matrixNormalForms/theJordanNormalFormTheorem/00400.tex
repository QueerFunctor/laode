\begin{exercise}  \label{c10.5.2B}
A $5\times 5$ matrix $A$ has three eigenvalues equal
to $4$ and two eigenvalues equal to $-3$.  List the possible Jordan normal 
forms for $A$ (up to similarity).  Suppose that you can ask your computer to
compute the nullity of precisely two matrices.  Can you devise a strategy for
determining the Jordan normal form of $A$?  Explain your answer.

\begin{solution}
\ans There are six different Jordan normal form matrices.

\soln  There are $3$ different Jordan matrices associated with the eigenvalue $4$ and
$2$ different Jordan matrices associated with the eigenvalue $-3$.  Altogether, there
are $3\cdot 2=6$ different Jordan matrices.

\begin{exercise}  \label{c10.4.4}
Let 
\[
A=\mattwo{2}{5}{-2}{0}.
\]
Find a complex $2\times 2$ matrix $T$ such that $T\inv AT$ is complex
diagonal and a real $2\times 2$ matrix $S$ so that $S\inv AS$ is in real
block diagonal form.

\begin{solution}

\ans $T = \mattwoc{5}{5}{-1+3i}{-1-3i}$ and $S=\mattwoc{5}{-1}{0}{3}$ 

\soln The eigenvalues of $A$ are $1\pm 3i$ and the associated eigenvectors 
are $(5,-1\pm 3i)^t$.  The columns of $T$ are just the eigenvectors of $A$
and the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors are the columns of $S$. 


\end{solution}

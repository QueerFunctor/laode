\begin{exercise} \label{c10.4.rotate}
Use {\sf map}\index{\computer!map} to verify that 
the normal form matrices \eqref{E:normalfm2} are 
just rotations followed by dilatations.  In particular, use {\sf map} to 
study the normal form matrix
\[
A = \mattwo{1}{-1}{1}{1}.
\]
Then compare your results with the similar matrix
\[
B = \mattwo{2}{1}{-2}{0}.
\]

\begin{solution}

Matrix $A$ rotates a vector by $45^{\circ}$ counterclockwise, then expands
the vector by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.  Let $v_1 = Av_0$, $v_2 =
Av_1$, and so on.  Note that $v_8 = 16v_0$.  That is, after eight
iterations, the vector points in its original direction and has length
$16|v_0|$.

\para Let $w_1 = Bv_0$ and $w_2 = Bw_1$.  Then, $w_8 = 16v_0
= v_8$.  The rotation and dilatation caused by matrix $B$ coincides
with that of matrix $A$ every 8 iterations, or $360^\circ$.  However,
$B$ does not cause a single constant rotation or dilatation on each
iteration, as does $A$.

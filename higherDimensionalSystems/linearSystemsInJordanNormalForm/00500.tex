Consider the differential equation $\dot{X}=JX$ where $J$ is the single Jordan 
block $2\times 2$ matrix with double eigenvalue $0$.  Show that most 
solutions are unbounded in both forward and backward time.

\begin{solution}
The differential equation $\dot{X}=JX$, where $J$ is the 
single Jordan block $2\times 2$ matrix with double eigenvalue $0$, is
\[
\dot{X} = \mattwo{0}{1}{0}{0}X.
\]
Solutions to this differential equation are:
\[
X(t) = e^{tJ}X_0 = \mattwo{1}{t}{0}{1}\vectwo{x_0}{y_0} =
\cvectwo{x_0+y_0t}{y_0}.
\]
As long as $y_0\neq 0$, the solution is unbounded in both forward and 
backward time.  Most solutions start with initial condition $y_o\neq 0$.

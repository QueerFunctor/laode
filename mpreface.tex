\section*{Preface}

This {\em Solutions Manual\/} contains solutions to the problems 
in the text {\em Linear Algebra and Differential Equations Using
\Matlabp$^\tm$} by Martin Golubitsky and Michael Dellnitz.  We give 
answers to the problems and complete discussions of the solutions.

\quad The solutions were written over a several year period and incorporate
feedback from a number of students.   We wish to thank the many people whose 
efforts resulted in this manual.  In particular, we thank Michael Dellnitz,  
Fritz Foss, and Kimber Gross for their time and efforts; and we also thank 
Denny Brown, Michael Friedberg, Natascha Filipski, Barbara Keyfitz, Steven 
Fuchs, and David Wagner for their help at various stages in this project.

The subjects of linear algebra and differential equations involve
manipulating vector equations.  In this chapter we introduce our
notation for vectors and matrices --- and we introduce \Matlabp,
a computer program that is designed to perform vector
manipulations in a natural way.

We begin, in Section~\ref{S:1.1}, by defining vectors and matrices, and
by explaining how to add and scalar multiply vectors and matrices.
In Section~\ref{S:1.2} we explain how to enter vectors and matrices
into \Matlabp, and how to perform the operations of addition and
scalar multiplication in \Matlabp.  There are many special types of matrices;
these types are introduced in Section~\ref{S:1.3}. In the concluding
section, we introduce the geometric interpretations of vector addition
and scalar multiplication; in addition we discuss the angle between
vectors through the use of the dot product of two vectors.

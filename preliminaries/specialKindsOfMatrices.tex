There are many matrices that have special forms and hence
have special names --- which we now list.

\begin{itemize}

\item A {\em square\/} matrix\index{matrix!square} is a matrix
with the same number of rows and columns; that is, a square
matrix is an $n\times n$ matrix.

\item A {\em diagonal\/} matrix\index{matrix!diagonal} is a
square matrix whose only
nonzero entries are along the main diagonal; that is, $a_{ij}=0$
if $i\neq j$.  The following is a $3\times 3$ diagonal matrix
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3
\end{array} \right).
\]
There is a shorthand in \Matlab for entering diagonal matrices. To
enter this $3\times 3$ matrix, type {\tt diag([1 2 3])}\index{\computer!diag}.

\item The {\em identity\/} matrix\index{matrix!identity} is the
diagonal matrix all of whose diagonal entries equal $1$.  The
$n\times n$ identity matrix is denoted by $I_n$.  This identity
matrix is entered in \Matlab by typing {\tt eye(n)}\index{\computer!eye}.

\item A {\em zero\/} matrix \index{matrix!zero} is a matrix all
of whose entries are $0$. A zero matrix is denoted by $0$.  This
notation is ambiguous since there is a zero $m\times n$ matrix
for every $m$ and $n$.  Nevertheless, this ambiguity rarely
causes any difficulty.  In \Matlabp, to define an $m\times n$
matrix $A$ whose entries all equal $0$, just type
{\tt A = zeros(m,n)}\index{\computer!zeros}.
To define an $n\times n$ zero matrix $B$, type {\tt B = zeros(n)}.

\item The {\em transpose\/}\index{matrix!transpose} of an $m\times n$
matrix $A$ is the $n\times m$ matrix obtained from $A$ by
interchanging rows and columns.  Thus the transpose of the
$4\times 2$ matrix
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rr} 2 & 1 \\ -1 & 2 \\ 3 & -4 \\ 5 & 7
\end{array}\right)
\]
is the $2\times 4$ matrix
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrrr} 2 & -1 & 3 & 5 \\ 1 & 2 & -4 & 7
\end{array}\right).
\]
Suppose that you enter this $4\times 2$ matrix into \Matlab by
typing
\begin{verbatim}
A = [2 1; -1 2; 3 -4; 5 7]
\end{verbatim}
The transpose of a matrix $A$ is denoted by $A^t$.  To compute
the transpose of $A$ in \Matlabp, just type {\tt A$'$}.
\index{\computer!'}

\item A {\em symmetric\/} matrix\index{matrix!symmetric} is a
square matrix whose entries are symmetric about the main
diagonal; that is $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$.  Note that a symmetric matrix
is a square matrix $A$ for which $A^t=A$.

\item An {\em upper triangular\/} matrix\index{matrix!upper
triangular} is a square matrix all of whose entries below the
main diagonal are $0$; that is, $a_{ij}=0$ if $i>j$.  A {\em
strictly upper triangular\/} matrix is an upper triangular
matrix whose diagonal entries are also equal to $0$.  Similar
definitions hold for {\em lower triangular\/}\index{matrix!lower triangular}
and {\em strictly lower triangular\/} matrices.  The following four 
$3\times 3$ matrices are examples of upper triangular, strictly upper 
triangular, lower triangular, and strictly lower triangular matrices:
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & 2 & 3\\ 0 & 2 & 4\\ 0 & 0 & 6\end{array}\right)
\quad
\left(\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & 2 & 3\\ 0 & 0 & 4\\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)
\]
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr} 7 & 0 & 0\\ 5 & 2 & 0\\ -4 & 1 & -3\end{array}\right)
\quad
\left(\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & 0 & 0\\ 5 & 0 & 0\\ 10 & 1 & 0\end{array}\right).
\]

\item A square matrix $A$ is {\em block diagonal\/}
\index{matrix!block diagonal} if
\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} B_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & B_2 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & B_k \end{array} \right)
\]
where each $B_j$ is itself a square matrix. An example of a $5\times 5$
block diagonal matrix with one $2\times 2$ block and one $3\times 3$ block is:
\[
\left(\begin{array}{ccccc} 2 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 4\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 5\end{array}\right).
\]


\end{itemize}

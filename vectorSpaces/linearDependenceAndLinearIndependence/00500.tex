\begin{exercise} \label{c5.4.4}
For which values of $b$ are the vectors $(1,b,2b)$ and $(2,1,4)$
linearly independent?

\begin{solution}

\ans The vectors $(1,b,2b)$ and $(2,1,4)$ are linearly independent
for any value of $b$.

\soln Two vectors are linearly independent unless one is a multiple
of the other; in this case, unless
\[
(1,b,2b) = \alpha(2,1,4).
\]
Equality holds if $2\alpha = 1$, $\alpha = b$, and $4\alpha = 2b$.
Therefore, $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{2}$ and $b = 1$,
which is inconsistent, so the vectors are linearly independent.

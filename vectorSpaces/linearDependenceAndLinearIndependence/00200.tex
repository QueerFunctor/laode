Let $w$ be a vector in the vector space $V$.  Show that the sets of vectors
$\{w,0\}$ and $\{w,-w\}$ are linearly dependent.

\begin{solution}

To show that the set of vectors $\{w_1,w_2\}$ is linearly dependent,
show that there exist nonzero $a$ and $b$ such that
$aw_1 + bw_2 = 0$.  For the set $\{w,0\}$, if $a = 0$ and $b = 1$,
then $0w + 1(0) = 0$, so the set is linearly dependent.  For the
set $\{w,-w\}$, if $a = 1$ and $b = 1$, then
$w - w = 0$, so the set is linearly dependent.

\begin{exercise} \label{c5.4.9}
Perform the following experiments.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]   Use \Matlab to choose randomly three column vectors in
$\R^3$.  The \Matlab commands to choose these vectors are:
\begin{verbatim}
y1 = rand(3,1)
y2 = rand(3,1)
y3 = rand(3,1)
\end{verbatim}\index{\computer!rand}
Use the methods of this section to determine whether these vectors
are linearly independent or linearly dependent.
\item[(b)]  Now perform this exercise five times and record the number
of times a linearly independent set of vectors is chosen and the
number of times a linearly dependent set is chosen.
\item[(c)]  Repeat the experiment in (b) --- but this time randomly
choose four vectors in $\R^3$ to be in your set.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) The set of commands to perform this experiment is:
\begin{verbatim}
y1 = rand(3,1);
y2 = rand(3,1);
y3 = rand(3,1);
A = [y1 y2 y3];
rref(A)
\end{verbatim}
If the resulting matrix is $I_3$, then the set is linearly
independent.

(b) The most likely outcome is that all five trials result in
linearly independent sets.

(c) Every trial yields a linearly dependent set of vectors.

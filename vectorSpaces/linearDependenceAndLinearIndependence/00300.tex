\begin{exercise} \label{c5.4.2}
For which values of $b$ are the vectors $(1,b)$ and $(3,-1)$
linearly independent?

\begin{solution}

\ans The set is linearly independent if $b \neq -\frac{1}{3}$.

\soln Note that a set of two vectors is linearly dependent if one is
a multiple of the other.  So this set is dependent for any values of
$b$ at which
\[
(3,-1) = \alpha(1,b).
\]
When equality holds $\alpha = 3$.  Therefore, $b = -\frac{1}{3}$.

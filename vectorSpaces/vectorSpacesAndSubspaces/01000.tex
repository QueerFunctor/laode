Show that the set of all solutions to the differential equation
$\dot{x}=2x$ is a subspace of $\CCone$.

\begin{solution}

The set of all solutions to the differential equation $\dot{x} = 2x$ is
indeed a subspace of $\CCone$.  To demonstrate, let $x_1$ and $x_2$
be elements of this set.  The set is closed under addition since
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(x_1 + x_2) = \frac{d}{dt}(x_1) + \frac{d}{dt}(x_2)
= 2x_1 + 2x_2 = 2(x_1 + x_2)
\]
and closed under scalar multiplication since, for any real scalar $r$,
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(rx_1) = r\frac{d}{dt}(x_1) = 2(rx_1).
\]
Note that this problem provides another example of the principle of
superposition.

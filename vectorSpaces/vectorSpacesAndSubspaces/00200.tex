\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.1}
Verify that the set $V_1$ consisting of all scalar multiples of
$(1,-1,-2)$ is a subspace of $\R^3$.

\begin{solution}

The set $V_1 \subset \R^3$ is a subspace.
The set $V_1$ contains all vectors $(a,-a,-2a)$,
where $a \in \R$.  We can show that it is closed under
vector addition, since
\[
a(1,-1,-2) + b(1,-1,-2) = (a + b)(1,-1,-2) \in V_1
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are scalars.  The set $V_1$ is closed under scalar
multiplication since
\[
b(a(1,-1,-2) = (ba)(1,-1,-2) \in V_1.
\]

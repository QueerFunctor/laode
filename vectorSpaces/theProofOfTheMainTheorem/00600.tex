Let $W$ be an infinite dimensional subspace of the vector space $V$.
Show that $V$ is infinite dimensional.

\begin{solution}
Let $W$ be an infinite dimensional subspace of the vector 
space $V$.  We want to show that $V$ is infinite dimensional.  Suppose that
$V$ is finite dimensional with $\dim V=n$.  Then Corollary~\ref{basis<n}
states that any set of linear independent 
vectors in $V$ has at most $n$ vectors.  Since $W$ is infinite dimensional, 
there exists a linearly independent set of vectors in $W\subset V$ with more 
than $n$ vectors.  This is a contradiction and $V$ must be infinite 
dimensional.

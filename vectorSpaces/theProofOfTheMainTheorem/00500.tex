Show that the vectors
\[
v_1=(2,3,1) \AND v_2=(1,1,3)
\]
are linearly independent.   Show that the span of $v_1$ and $v_2$
forms a plane in $\R^3$ by showing that every linear combination
 is the solution to a single linear equation.  Use this equation
to determine the normal vector $N$ to this plane.  Verify
Lemma~\ref{extendindep} by verifying directly that $v_1,v_2,N$
are linearly independent vectors.

\begin{solution}

There is no scalar $\alpha$ such that $(2,3,1) = \alpha(1,1,3)$, so
$v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent.
The set of linear combinations of $v_1$ and $v_2$ is the set of
solutions to
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrl}
2a_1 & + & 3a_1 & + & a_3 & = & 0 \\
a_1 & + & a_2 & + & 3a_3 & = & 0. \end{array}
\]
Row reducing this system yields $a_1 = -8a_3$ and $a_2 = 5a_3$.
Let $a_3 = 0$.  Then every linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$ is
of the form
\[
8x_1 - 5x_2 - x_3 = 0
\]
which is the equation of a plane in $\R^3$.  The normal vector to this
plane is $N = (8,-5,-1)$.  Row reduce the matrix whose columns
are the vectors $v_1$, $v_2$, and $N$ to verify that these vectors
are linearly independent.
\[
\matthree{2}{1}{8}{3}{1}{-5}{1}{3}{-1} \longrightarrow
\matthree{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}.
\]
So the vectors are indeed linearly independent, verifying
Lemma~\ref{extendindep}.

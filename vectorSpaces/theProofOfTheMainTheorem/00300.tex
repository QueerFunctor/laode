Let $A$ be a $7\times 5$ matrix with $\rank(A)=r$.\index{rank}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]	What is the largest value that $r$ can have?
\item[(b)]	Give a condition equivalent to the system of
	equations $Ax=b$ having a solution.
\item[(c)]	What is the dimension of the null space of $A$?
\item[(d)]	If there is a solution to $Ax=b$, then how many
parameters are needed to describe the set of all solutions?
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) The largest value that $r$ can have is $5$, since the matrix has
$5$ columns.  Thus, the reduced echelon form matrix can have at most
$5$ pivot points.

(b) The equation $Ax = b$ has a solution if the rank of the augmented
matrix $(A|b)$ is $r$.  If $\rank (A|b)$ is greater than $r$, then
there is a pivot in the $6^{th}$ column and the system is
inconsistent, so there is no solution.

(c) The null space has dimension $5 - r$.

(d) The number of parameters needed to describe the solution to
$Ax = b$ is $5 - r$, since $5 - r$ parameters are needed to describe
the solutions to $Ax = 0$, and the solutions to the inhomogeneous
system are obtained by adding the solutions of the homogeneous system
to one solution of the inhomogeneous system.

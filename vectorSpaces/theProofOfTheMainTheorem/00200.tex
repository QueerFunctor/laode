The pairs of vectors
\[
     v_1=(-1,1,0) \AND v_2=(1,0,1)
\]
span a plane $P$ in $\R^3$.  The pairs of vectors
\[
        w_1=(0,1,0) \AND w_2=(1,1,0)
\]
span a plane $Q$ in $\R^3$.  Show that $P$ and $Q$
are different and compute the subspace of $\R^3$ that
is given by the intersection $P\cap Q$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The intersection of the planes is $P \cap Q = s(1,-1,0)$ for any
real scalar $s$.

\soln The planes $P$ and $Q$ are not equal if the normal vectors $P_N$
and $Q_N$ point in different directions.  Solving by row reduction
yields $P_N = (-1,-1,1)$ and $Q_N = (0,0,1)$, so $P \neq Q$.

\para Since $P$ and $Q$ are not the same plane and also are not
parallel, they intersect in a line.  The intersection $P \cap Q$ is
the simultaneous solutions to the equations for planes $P$ and $Q$,
that is:
\[ \begin{array}{rrrrrrl}
-x & - & y & + & z & = & 0 \\
& & & & z & = & 0. \end{array} \]
Solve by row reduction or substitution to obtain $x = -y$ and $z = 0$.

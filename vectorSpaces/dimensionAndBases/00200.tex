\begin{exercise} \label{c5.5.1}
Show that ${\cal U}=\{u_1,u_2,u_3\}$ where
\[
u_1=(1,1,0) \quad u_2=(0,1,0) \quad u_3=(-1,0,1)
\]
is a basis for $\R^3$.

\begin{solution}

By Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep},
${\cal U}$ is a basis for $\R^3$ if the vectors of ${\cal U}$ are
linearly independent and span $\R^3$.  By Lemma~\ref{L:computerank},
the dimension of ${\cal U}$ is equal to the rank of the matrix whose
rows are $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$.  Row reduce this matrix:
\[
\matthree{1}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}{-1}{0}{1} \longrightarrow
\matthree{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}.
\]
So $\dim({\cal U}) = 3 = \dim(\R^3)$, and we need now only show that
$u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$ are linearly independent, which we can do by
row reducing the matrix whose columns are the vectors of ${\cal U}$ as
follows:
\[
\matthree{1}{0}{-1}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1} \longrightarrow
\matthree{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}.
\]
Therefore, there is no nonzero solution to the equation
${\cal U}r = 0$, so the vectors of ${\cal U}$ are linearly independent
and ${\cal U}$ is a basis for $\R^3$.

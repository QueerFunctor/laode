\begin{exercise} \label{c5.5.7}
Let $u\in\R^n$ be a nonzero row vector.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Show that the $n\times n$ matrix $A=u^tu$ is symmetric and
  that $\rank(A)=1$.  {\bf Hint:} Begin by showing that $Av^t=0$ for
  every row vector $v\in\R^n$ that is perpendicular to $u$ and that
  $Au^t$ is a nonzero multiple of $u^t$.
\item[(b)]  Show that the matrix $P=I_n+u^tu$ is invertible.  {\bf Hint:}
Show that $\rank(P)=n$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) The matrix $A$ is symmetric because, by \eqref{e:transposeprod},
\[
A^t = (u^tu)^t = u^tu = A.
\]
To show that $\rank(A) = 1$, let $v$ be a vector such that $u \cdot
v = 0$.  This implies $uv^t = 0$, and thus $Av^t = u^t(uv^t) = 0$
for all vectors $v$.  The span of vectors perpendicular to $u$ has
dimension $n - 1$, so $\null(A) \geq n - 1$.  We know that $uu^t
= u \cdot u = ||u||$.  Thus, $Au^t = u^tuu^t = ||u||u^t$.  Since
$u$ is a nonzero vector, $||u|| \neq 0$, so $Au^t$ is a nonzero
multiple of $u^t$.  Therefore, $A$ is not the zero matrix, so
$\null(A) = n - 1$, and therefore $\rank(A) = 1$.

(b) The matrix $P$ is invertible if $P$ is row equivalent to $I_n$,
that is, if $\rank(P) = n$.  To show that this is true, again let $v$
be any vector perpendicular to $u$.  Then:
\[
Pv^t = (I_n + u^tu)v^t = v^t + 0 = v^t.
\]
Thus, $\rank(P) \geq n - 1$.  In addition
\[
Pu^t = (I_n + u^tu)u^t = u^t + ||u||u^t = (1 + ||u||)u^t
\]
which, since $||u|| > 0$, is a nonzero multiple of $u^t$.  Therefore,
$\rank(P) = n$ and $P$ is invertible.

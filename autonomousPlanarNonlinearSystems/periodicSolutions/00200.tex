Use phase -- amplitude equations to find a system of differential equations 
that has exactly three limit cycles.

\begin{solution}

\soln A sample system of differential equations has the form of 
\eqref{e:HopfNF}, where $a(r^2) = (r^2-1)(r^2-2)(r^2-3)$
and $b(r^2) = 1$.

\soln  Choose any system of differential equations that has the form of 
\eqref{e:HopfNF} where $a(r^2)$ has three positive roots
and $b(r^2)$ is nowhere zero.

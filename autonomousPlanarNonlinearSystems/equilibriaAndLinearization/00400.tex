\begin{exercise} \label{c8.2.3}
More generally, consider the population growth model
\begin{equation} \label{E:pop}
\frac{dp}{dt} = \lambda(p) p, 
\end{equation}
where the growth rate depends on the population.  Assume
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] the growth rate is positive when the population is 
small, that is, $\lambda(0)>0$, and 
\item[(ii)] the growth rate decreases as the population
increases, that is, $\frac{d\lambda}{dp} < 0$ for all $p$.
\end{enumerate}
Consider the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Show that equation \eqref{E:pop} has at most one
positive equilibrium $p_e>0$.
\item[(b)] Let $p(t)$ be a solution to \eqref{E:pop} with
$p(0)>0$. Determine the asymptotic limit of the population in
forward time, that is, determine $\dps\lim_{t\to\infty} p(t)$. 
\item[(c)] Relate your answer in (b) to the solution to
Exercise~\ref{E:popex}. 
\end{enumerate}
{\bf Hint:} There are two possible answers to (b) depending on
whether \eqref{E:pop} has one positive equilibrium or no positive 
equilibria.

\begin{solution}

(a) We are given $\frac{d\lambda}{dp} < 0$ for all $p$.  Thus $\lambda(p)$ is a 
monotonic decreasing function of $p$ when $p>0$ and the graph of 
$\lambda(p)$ can intersect $\lambda=0$ in at most one point.
Therefore, \eqref{E:pop} has at most one positive equilibrium.

(b) \ans If there exists a positive equilibrium $p_e$, then
$\dps\lim_{p \to \infty} p(t) = p_e$.  If no positive equilibrium
exists, then $\dps\lim_{p \to \infty} p(t) = \infty$.

\soln If there is a positive equilibrium, then it is asymptotically stable.
To verify this point differentiate the right hand side of \eqref{E:pop} with respect to 
$p$ and evaluate at $p=p_e$ obtaining
\[
\left.\frac{d}{dp}(\lambda(p)p)\right|_{p=p_e} = 
\lambda(p_e) + \lambda'(p_e)p_e = \lambda'(p_e)p_e <0
\]
since $\lambda(p_e) = 0$, $\lambda'(p_e) < 0$, and $p_e > 0$.  
So $p = p_e$ is a stable equilibrium, and the population limits on
$p_e$.

\para If no positive equilibrium exists, then $p = 0$, which is unstable,
is the only equilibrium, and the population grows without bound.

(c) Exercise~\ref{E:popex} is a specific example of \eqref{E:pop} in
which a positive equilibrium exists at $p = \frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.

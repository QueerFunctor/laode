\begin{computerExercise} \label{c8.2.10}
Use {\pplane} to determine the phase portraits of the nonlinear system
\eqref{e:nonhypcenter}.  Verify that {\pplane} finds (approximately) 
periodic solutions on sufficiently small neighborhoods of the origin.  This 
experiment, coupled with the results from Exercise~\ref{E:nonhyp}, suggests 
that the numerical methods employed by {\pplane} fail sufficiently close 
to nonhyperbolic equilibria.

\begin{solution}

System \eqref{e:nonhypcenter} is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.2.10}a with four
trajectories.  Figure~\ref{c8.2.10}b shows the system in a small
neighborhood of the origin.  In this graph, trajectories appear to be
closed orbits.  Using the {\tt find an equilibrium} command, we find
that \Matlab considers the origin to be a spiral.

Recall that the simplest population growth model
\index{population model} is 
\[
\frac{dp}{dt} = \lambda p,
\]
where $p(t)$ is the population at time $t$ and $\lambda$ is the
population growth rate. Suppose that the growth rate depends on
the size of the population, as follows:
\[
\lambda(p) = \lambda_0 - ap,
\]
where $\lambda_0>0$ and $a>0$ are constants.  Suppose that
$p(t)$ is a solution and $p(0)>0$.  What is the asymptotic
limit of the population in forward time, that is, what is
$\dps\lim_{t\to\infty} p(t)$?

\begin{solution}

\ans The asymptotic limit of the population in forward time is
$\frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.

\soln Substitute $\lambda(p)$ into the population model, obtaining
\[
\frac{dp}{dt} = (\lambda_0 - ap)p\equiv f(p).
\]
Solve for $f(p)= 0$ to find that the system has equilibria
at $p = 0$ and $p = \frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.  Then, find that
\[
\frac{df}{dp}(0) = \lambda_0 > 0 \AND
\frac{df}{dp}(\lambda_0/a) = -\lambda_0 < 0;
\]
so the equilibrium at $p = 0$ is unstable and the equilibrium at
$p = \frac{\lambda_0}{a} > 0$ is stable.  Therefore, a solution with 
initial population $p(0) > 0$ limits on $\frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.

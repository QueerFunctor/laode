Use \Matlab to solve the initial value problem
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = x,\quad x(0)=1
\]
(a) by the implicit Euler method, and (b) by the implicit trapezoidal 
rule on the interval $[0,2]$.  In each case use the step size $h=0.1$.
{\bf Hint:} Before working with \Matlabp, use this specific differential
equation to solve explicitly for $x_{k+1}$ in \eqref{eq:impleulit} and 
\eqref{eq:imtrap}.

\begin{solution}

(a) The implicit Euler method applied to the given initial
value problem takes the form
\[
t_{k+1} = t_k + h\AND x_{k+1} = x_k + h x_{k+1}.
\]
We can solve the second equation  for $x_{k+1}$ and obtain
\[
x_{k+1} = \frac{x_k}{1-h}.
\]
The approximate solution is now obtained by the \Matlab commands
\begin{verbatim}
h    = 0.1;
t(1) = 0;
x(1) = 1;
K    = 20;
for k = 1:K
   t(k+1) = t(k)+h;
   x(k+1) = x(k)/(1-h);
end
plot(t,x,'o')
hold on
plot(t,x,'--')
\end{verbatim}

(b) The implicit trapezoidal rule applied to the given initial
value problem takes the form
\[
t_{k+1} = t_k + h\AND x_{k+1} = x_k + \frac{h}{2}(x_k+x_{k+1}).
\]
We can solve the second equation for $x_{k+1}$ and obtain
\[
x_{k+1} = \frac{1+\frac{h}{2}}{1-\frac{h}{2}}x_k.
\]
The approximate solution is now obtained by the \Matlab commands
\begin{verbatim}
h    = 0.1;
t(1) = 0;
x(1) = 1;
K    = 20;
for k = 1:K
   t(k+1) = t(k)+h;
   x(k+1) = (1+h/2)/(1-h/2)*x(k);
end
plot(t,x,'o')
hold on
plot(t,x,'--')
\end{verbatim}

\end{solution}

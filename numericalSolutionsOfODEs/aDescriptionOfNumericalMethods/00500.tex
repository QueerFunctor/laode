Consider the initial value problem
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dps\frac{dx}{dt}(t) & = & 1 \\
x(t_0) & = & 0.
\end{array}
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Suppose that a Runge-Kutta method leads to exact
results for all step sizes $h$, that is $x_k=x(t_k)$.  What 
does this imply for the numbers $b_1,\ldots,b_s$?
\item[(b)] Verify that the relation on the numbers $b_1,\ldots,b_s$
derived in part (a) is satisfied
for Euler's method, for the modified Euler method and for the
fourth order Runge-Kutta method.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans $\dps\sum_{i=1}^s b_i = 1$.

\soln For the given initial value problem we have $f(t,x)=1$.
Therefore the general Runge-Kutta method takes the form
\[
t_{k+1} = t_k + h\AND x_{k+1} = x_k + h\sum_{i=1}^s b_i.
\]
On the other hand the solution to the initial value problem is
given by $x(t) = t-t_0$ and $x_1=x(t_1)$ implies
\[
h = x(t_1) = x_1 = 0+h\sum_{i=1}^s b_i.
\]
Division by $h$ leads to the desired result.

(b) For Euler's method we have $b_1=1$, for the modified Euler
method we have $b_1=b_2=\frac{1}{2}$, and for the fourth order
Runge-Kutta method $b_1=b_4 = \frac{1}{6}$,
$b_2 = b_3 = \frac{2}{6}$.  Hence in each case $\sum_{i=1}^s b_i=1$.

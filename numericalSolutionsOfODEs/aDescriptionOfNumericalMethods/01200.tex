Use \Matlab to solve the initial value problem

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dps \frac{dx}{dt} & = & -y\\
\dps \frac{dy}{dt} & = & x,
\end{array}

where $(x(1),y(1))= (1,0)$.  Find an approximation 
on the interval $[0,12]$ with a step size $h=0.1$ using 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Euler's method;
\item[(b)] the implicit Euler method.
\end{itemize}
Write down the explicit solution of the initial
value problem and compare this with the numerical
results.  

\begin{solution}
The exact solution of the initial value problem
is given by $x(t) = \cos(t)$ and $y(t)=\sin(t)$.  Therefore the
solution describes a circle in the phase plane.

(a) Euler's method applied to the given initial value problem
takes the form
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vectwo{x_{k+1}}{y_{k+1}} & = &
\vectwo{x_k}{y_k} + h \vectwo{-y_k}{x_k}\\
t_{k+1} & = & t_k + h.
\end{array}
\]
Hence we can use the following \Matlab commands
\begin{verbatim}
h    = 0.1;
t(1) = 0;
x(1) = 1;
y(1) = 0;
K    = 120;
for k = 1:K
   t(k+1) = t(k)+h;
   x(k+1) = x(k)-h*y(k);
   y(k+1) = y(k)+h*x(k);
end
plot(x,y,'o')
hold on
plot(x,y,'--')
\end{verbatim}
to approximate the solution in the phase plane.  It can be observed
that the approximation obtained by Euler's method is spiraling out
rather than reproducing the circle.

(b)  The implicit Euler method applied to the given initial value
problem takes the form
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vectwo{x_{k+1}}{y_{k+1}} & = &
\vectwo{x_k}{y_k} + h \vectwo{-y_{k+1}}{x_{k+1}}\\
t_{k+1} & = & t_k + h.
\end{array}
\]
We can solve these linear equations for $x_{k+1}$ and $y_{k+1}$ to obtain
\[
x_{k+1} = \frac{x_k-hy_k}{1+h^2} \AND
y_{k+1} = \frac{y_k+hx_k}{1+h^2}.
\]
Hence we can use the following \Matlab commands
\begin{verbatim}
h    = 0.1;
t(1) = 0;
x(1) = 1;
y(1) = 0;
K    = 120;
for k = 1:K
   t(k+1) = t(k)+h;
   x(k+1) = (x(k)-h*y(k))/(1+h*h);
   y(k+1) = (y(k)+h*x(k))/(1+h*h);
end
plot(x,y,'o')
hold on
plot(x,y,'--')
\end{verbatim}
to approximate the solution in the phase plane.  It can be observed
that the approximation obtained by the implicit Euler method is
spiraling in rather than reproducing the circle.

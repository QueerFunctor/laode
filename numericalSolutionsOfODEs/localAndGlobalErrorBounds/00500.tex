Set $\lambda=0.2$ and the step size $h=0.1$.  Use \Matlab to compute 
the global discretization error and its bound in \eqref{eq:geestimate}
on the interval $[0,1]$.  Compare the result with the ones obtained 
in Figures~\ref{fig:globerr1} and \ref{fig:Lgeest}.

\begin{solution}

Proceeding as in the text we use the \Matlab commands
\begin{verbatim}
h      = 0.1;
L      = 0.2;
t(1)   = 0;
x(1)   = 1;
err(1) = 0;
est(1) = 0;
K      = 1/h;
for k = 1:K
     t(k+1) = t(k)+h;
     x(k+1) = (1+L*h)*x(k);
   err(k+1) = exp(L*t(k+1))-x(k+1);
   est(k+1) = exp(L)*(exp(L*k*h)-1)*L*h/2;
end
plot(t,err,'+')
hold on
plot(t,est,'x')
\end{verbatim}
to derive the desired result.  It can be seen that in this case
the error is significantly smaller than in Figures~\ref{fig:globerr1}
and \ref{fig:Lgeest} due to the fact that here $L=0.2$ is smaller
than in those cases.  In fact, the error is bounded by $0.003$.

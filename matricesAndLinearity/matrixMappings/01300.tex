\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c4.2.a4a} -- \ref{c4.2.a4c} use {\sf map} to
find vectors that are stretched and/or contracted to a multiple of
themselves by the given linear mapping.  {\bf Hint:}  Choose a vector in the
{\sf Map} window and apply {\sf Iterate} several times.
\begin{exercise} \label{c4.2.a4a}
$A=\mattwoc{2}{0}{1.5}{0.5}$.

\begin{solution}
The matrix $A$ maps any vector $x$ of the form
$x = s(1,1)^t$, where $s$ is a real scalar, to twice its length, and any
vector of the form $x = s(0,1)^t$ to half its length.

\para If you are having trouble finding this vector with {\tt map},
turn on the rescale vectors option, which scales every vector to length
$1$ after mapping it.  Then, test vectors by applying {\sf map} several
times until you find a vector which (approximately) maps to itself.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c4.2.a4b}
$B=\mattwo{1.2}{-1.5}{-0.4}{1.2}$.

\begin{solution}
The matrix $B$ maps any vector of the form
$x \approx s(-0.89,0.46)$ to approximately $1.97$ times its length.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c4.2.a4c}
$C=\mattwo{2}{-1.25}{0}{-0.5}$.

\begin{solution}
The matrix $C$ maps any vector of the form $x = s(1,0)$
to twice its length and maps any vector of the form $x = s(1,2)$ to
$-\frac{1}{2}$ times its length.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

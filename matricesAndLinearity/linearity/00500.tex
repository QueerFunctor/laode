Can the vector $z=(2,3,-1)$ be written as
\[
z=\alpha x+ \beta y
\]
where $x=(2,3,0)$ and $y=(1,-1,1)$?

\begin{solution}

\ans The vector $z = (2,3,-1)$ cannot be written as
\[
z = \alpha(2,3,0) + \beta(1,-1,1).
\]

\soln Write the equation
\[ (2,3,-1) = \alpha(2,3,0) + \beta(1,-1,1) = 
(2\alpha + \beta, 3\alpha - \beta, \beta) \]
as a linear system of two unknowns in three equations:
\[ \begin{array}{rrrrr}
2 & = & 2\alpha & + & \beta \\
3 & = & 3\alpha & - & \beta \\
-1 & = & \beta \end{array}. \]
Substituting $\beta = -1$ into the first and second equations
yields
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{3}{2} & = & \alpha \\
\frac{2}{3} & = & \alpha. \end{array} \]
The system is inconsistent, so there is no solution to the desired
equation.

\end{solution}

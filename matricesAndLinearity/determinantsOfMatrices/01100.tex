Use \Matlab to choose five $2\times 2$ matrices at random and compute
their inverses.  Do you get the impression that `typically'
$2\times 2$ matrices are invertible?  Try to find a reason for
this fact using the determinant of $2\times 2$ matrices.

\begin{solution}

A randomly selected $2 \times 2$ matrix is almost always invertible.
A matrix will fail to be invertible only if the determinant of the
matrix is $0$, which is seldom the case.

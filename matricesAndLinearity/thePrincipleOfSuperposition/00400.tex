\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find all solutions to the homogeneous equation
$Ax=0$ where
\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 2 & 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 4 \end{array}
\right).
\]
\item[(b)] Find a single solution to the inhomogeneous equation
\begin{equation}  \label{E:inhom}
Ax =\vectwo{6}{6}.
\end{equation}
\item[(c)] Use your answers in (a) and (b) to find all solutions
to \eqref{E:inhom}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans All solutions to the homogeneous equation are of the form
\[
x = \vecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} = s\vecthree{-11}{7}{1}.
\]

\soln Row reduce the matrix of the homogeneous system
$Ax = 0$ to obtain:
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & 0 & 11 \\ 0 & 1 & -7 \end{array}\right).
\]
So $x_1 = -11s$, $x_2 = 7s$ and $x_3 = s$.

(b) \ans One possible solution is
\[ \vecthree{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} = \vecthree{1}{1}{1}. \]

\soln Assign a value to $x_3$, then substitute into the two equations
of the inhomogeneous system to obtain values for $x_1$ and $x_2$.

(c) All solutions to \eqref{E:inhom} can be found by adding a
single solution of the inhomogeneous system to all solutions
of the homogeneous system, so:
\[
x = \vecthree{1}{1}{1} + s\vecthree{-11}{7}{1}.
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise} \label{A.3.4.1}
How many solutions can a homogeneous system of $4$ linear equations in $7$ unknowns have?

\begin{solution}
\ans The system must have infinitely many solutions.

The system must have a solution because homogeneous systems are always consistent.
The system cannot have a unique solution because the rank of the corresponding augmented matrix cannot exceed $4$ which is less than the number of variables $7$.
\end{solution}

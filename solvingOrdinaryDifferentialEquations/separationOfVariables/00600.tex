\begin{computerExercise} \label{c14.1.18}
The ability to find closed form solutions to differential equations enables
us to test the accuracy of numerically computed solutions.  As an example where difficulties arise in numerical computations, consider the differential 
equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:exivp}
\frac{dx}{dt} = \left(\frac{x}{t}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Use separation of variables to find the solution $x(t)$ to the 
initial value problem $x(0.001) = 2/1999$ of \eqref{eq:exivp}.
\item[(b)] Show that $\dps\lim_{t\to 2^-}x(t)=\infty$ for the solution of 
\eqref{eq:exivp} obtained in (a).
\item[(c)] For the initial condition specified in (a) compare the analytic 
solution of \eqref{eq:exivp} to the numerical solution computed by {\dfield} 
in the region where the maximum value of $t$ is $2.5$ and the maximum value of 
$x$ is $100$.  How does the behavior of the numerically computed solution 
to \eqref{eq:exivp} differ from that of the analytically computed solution?
\item[(d)]  Compute the solution of \eqref{eq:exivp} using the general initial 
condition $x(t_0) = x_0$ where $t_0,x_0>0$ and show that 
$\lim_{t\to 0^+}x(t)=0$ for every such solution. 
\end{itemize}
\noindent {\bf Comment:} Part (d) hints at why there is a discrepancy 
between the numerically approximated solution and the analytic solution: 
small errors in the approximate solution with initial condition $(t_0,x_0)$ 
near $(0,0)$ cause different solutions to be computed.

\begin{solution}
\ans The solution to the initial value problem is
\[
x(t) = \frac{2t}{2 - t}.
\]
Figure~\ref{c14.1.18}a shows this analytic solution, and
Figure~\ref{c14.1.18}b shows the {\tt dfield} solution to the initial
value problem.  The {\tt dfield} solution is a line, while the slope
of the analytic solution increases sharply past $t \approx 1.5$.

\soln The differential equation can be written as $\frac{dx}{dt} = g(x)h(t)$,
where $g(x) = x^2$ and $h(t) = t^{-2}$.  Then, $x(t)$ satisfies
\begin{equation} \label{eq:14.1.18}
G(x(t)) = H(t) + C,
\end{equation}
where
\[
\begin{array}{l}
G(x) = \int\frac{1}{g(x)}dx = \int\frac{1}{x^2}dx = -\frac{1}{x} \\
H(t) = \int h(t)dt = \int\frac{1}{t^2}dt = -\frac{1}{t}.
\end{array}
\]
and
\[
C = G(x_0) - H(t_0) = -\frac{1999}{2} + 1000  = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Substitute $G(x)$, $H(t)$, $t_0 = 0.001$ and $x_0 = 2/1999$ into
\eqref{eq:14.1.18}, obtaining
\[
-\frac{1}{x} = -\frac{1}{t} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Solve for $x$ to obtain the closed form solution to the initial value problem.

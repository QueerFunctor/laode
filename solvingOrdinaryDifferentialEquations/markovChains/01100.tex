Suppose that the original man in the text with umbrellas has only three
umbrellas instead of four.  What is the probability that on a given day he
will get wet going to work?

\begin{solution}

\ans The probability that the man will get wet going to work is $1.53\%$.

\soln Create the $4 \times 4$ matrices $P$ (the transition matrix between
morning and afternoon) and $Q$ (the transition matrix between afternoon
and the next morning), then multiply to obtain \begin{verbatim}
R =
    0.7000    0.3000         0         0
    0.1400    0.6200    0.2400         0
         0    0.1400    0.6200    0.2400
         0         0    0.1400    0.8600
\end{verbatim}
Find the eigenvector $V$ of $R$.  The first element of $V$ is $0.0763$,
the probability that there will be no umbrella in the house on a given
morning.  Multiply this by the probability that it will rain in the
morning to obtain the solution.

\begin{exercise} \label{c4.10.6}
A truck rental company has locations in three cities A, B and C.
Statistically, the company knows that the trucks rented at one location will
be returned in one week to the three locations in the following proportions.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
\hline
Rental Location &  Returned to A & Returned to B & Returned to C\\
\hline
A  & 75\% & 10\%  & 15\% \\
\hline
B & 5\% & 85\% & 10\% \\
\hline
C & 20\% & 20\% & 60\%\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Suppose that the company has 250 trucks.  How should the company distribute
the trucks so that the number of trucks available at each location remains
approximately constant from one week to the next?

\begin{solution}

\ans The company should put $70$ trucks in city $A$, $123$ trucks in city
$B$, and $57$ trucks in city $C$.

\soln Given initial truck distribution $V_0 = (V_A,V_B,V_C)$, the
distribution after $k$ weeks is $(P^t)^kV_0$, where $P$ is the transition
matrix for the movement of trucks.  As $k \rightarrow \infty$, $(P^t)^k$
approaches
\begin{verbatim}
    0.2807    0.2807    0.2807
    0.4912    0.4912    0.4912
    0.2281    0.2281    0.2281
\end{verbatim}
So, if the distribution of trucks is to remain constant, then, for large
values of $k$,
\[
\vecthree{V_A}{V_B}{V_C} = (P^t)^kV_0 = \cvecthree{0.2807(V_A +
V_B + V_C}{0.4912(V_A + V_B + V_C}{0.2281(V_A + V_B + V_C} =
\cvecthree{70.1754}{122.8070}{57.0175}.
\]

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

Suppose that the probability that it will rain in the morning in $p=0.3$ and
the probability that it will rain in the afternoon is $q=0.25$.  In the man
with umbrellas example, what is the probability that the man will be at home
with no umbrellas while it is raining?

\begin{solution}

\ans The probability that the man will be at home in the morning with
no umbrella while it is raining is $7.19\%$. 

\soln Create the matrix $P$ which relates the number of umbrellas in the
house in the morning to the number in the house in the afternoon and the
matrix $Q$ which relates the number of umbrellas in the house in the
afternoon to the number there the next morning, then compute {\tt R = P*Q}:
\begin{verbatim}
R =
    0.7500    0.2500         0         0         0
    0.2250    0.6000    0.1750         0         0
         0    0.2250    0.6000    0.1750         0
         0         0    0.2250    0.6000    0.1750
         0         0         0    0.2250    0.7750
\end{verbatim}
Find the eigenvector $V$ of $R$ by computing $(R^t)^k$ for large values
of $k$.  The first element of $V$ is $0.2398$, the probability that there
will be no umbrella in the house on a given morning.  Multiply this
value by the probability that it will rain on any given morning to get
the probability that the man will have no umbrella on a rainy morning.

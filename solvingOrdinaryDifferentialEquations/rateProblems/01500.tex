In the beginning of the year 1990 the population of the United States was
approximately 250,000,000 people and the growth rate was estimated at $3\%$
per year.  Assuming that the growth rate does not change, during what year
will the population of the United States reach 400,000,000?

\begin{solution}

\ans According to this population model, the population of the United States
reaches 400,000,000 in the year 2005.

\soln Note that the population model represents a continuous growth
function $p(t) = p_0e^{rt}$.  Let $t$ be time in years, starting in 1990. 
So $p_0 = 250$ million.  The growth rate $r$ is $0.03$.  Thus, the
population at time $t$ (in millions) is $P(t) = 250e^{0.03t}$.
The population will reach 400,000,000 when $400 = 250e^{0.03t}$.
Solving for $t$ yields $t \approx 15.67$, that is, in the year 2005.

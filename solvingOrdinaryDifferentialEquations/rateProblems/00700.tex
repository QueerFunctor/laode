\begin{exercise} \label{c3.1.5} \index{Newton's law of cooling}
Newton's law of cooling states that the rate at which a body changes
temperature is proportional to the difference between the body
temperature and the temperature of the surrounding medium.  That is,
\begin{equation}  \label{e:Newton}
\frac{dT}{dt} = \alpha(T-T_m)
\end{equation}
where $T(t)$ is the temperature of the body at time $t$, $T_m$ is the
constant temperature of the surrounding medium, and $\alpha$ is the
constant of proportionality.  Suppose the
body is in air of temperature $50^\circ$ and the body cools from
$100^\circ$ to $75^\circ$ in $20$ minutes.  What will the temperature
of the body be after one hour?  {\bf Hint:} Rewrite \eqref{e:Newton} in
terms of $U(t) = T(t) - T_m$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The temperature after $1$ hour will be $T(1) = 56.25^{\circ}$.

\soln Let $U = T - T_m$.  Since $T_m = 50$ is a constant,
\[
\frac{dU}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(T - T_m) = \frac{dT}{dt}.
\]
We also know that
\[
\frac{dU}{dt} = \alpha (T - T_m) = \alpha U. \]
Therefore \[ T(t) - T_m = U(t) = Ke^{\alpha t}. \]
So \[ T(t) = Ke^{\alpha t} + T_m = Ke^{\alpha t} + 50. \]

Use the information $T(0) = 100$ in the formula for $T(t)$ to find that
$K = 50$.  Next, use $T(\frac{1}{3}) = 75$ to get $\alpha = -3\ln{2}$. So,
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
T(t) & = & 50e^{(-3\ln{2})t} + 50 \\
T(1) & = & 50e^{-3\ln{2}} + 50 = 56.25^{\circ}.\end{array}
\]

\end{solution}

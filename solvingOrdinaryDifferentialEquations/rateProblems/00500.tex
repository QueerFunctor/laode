Bacteria grown in a culture increase at a rate proportional to the
number present.  If the number of bacteria doubles every $2$ hours,
then how many bacteria will be pre\-sent af\-ter $5$ hours?  Express
your answer in terms of $x_0$, the initial number of bacteria.

\begin{solution}

\ans After $5$ hours, the amount of bacteria present will be
$x(5) = x_0e^{\frac{5}{2} \ln 2} \approx 5.66x_0$.

\soln Note that the rate of growth is proportional to the amount of
bacteria, so $\frac{dx}{dt} = \lambda x(t)$.  The initial value problem
implies $x(t) = x_0e^{\lambda t}$.  The amount of bacteria doubles after
two hours.  So, at time $t = 2$, $2x_0 = x_0e^{2\lambda}$ and
$\lambda = \frac{1}{2} \ln 2$.  Therefore,
\[ x(t) = x_0e^{\frac{1}{2} (\ln 2)t}. \]
We substitute $t = 5$ into this formula to find the amount of
bacteria after 5 hours.

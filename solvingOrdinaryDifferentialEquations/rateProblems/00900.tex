\begin{exercise} \label{c3.1.7A}
You deposit \$4,000 in a bank at an interest of $5.5\%$ but after half 
a year the bank changes the interest rate to $4.5\%$.  Suppose that the 
interest is compounded continuously.  How much money will be in your 
account after one year?

\begin{solution}
\ans After one year, you will have \$$4205.08$ in your account.

\soln Let $P_0 = 4000$ be the initial amount of money in the account. 
During the first half of the year, the money in the account grows to $P_1 =
P_0e^{0.5r_1}$, where $r_1 = 0.055$.  During the second half of the year,
the money in the account grows to $P = P_1e^{0.5r_2}$, where $r_2 = 0.045$.
So, after one year, the money in the account is
\[
P = P_0e^{0.5r_1}e^{0.5r_2} = P_0e^{0.5(r_1 + r_2)} = 4000e^{0.5(0.1)}.
\]

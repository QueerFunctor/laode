Suppose you deposit \$10,000 in a bank at an
interest of $7.5\%$ compounded continuously.
How much money will be in your account a year and a half later?
How much would you have if the interest were compounded monthly?

\begin{solution}

\ans After a year and a half, given instantaneously compounded
interest, you would have
$P_{instant}(1.5) = \mbox{\$}11\mbox{,}190.72$.
Alternatively, if interest is compounded monthly, you would have
$P_{monthly}(1.5) = \mbox{\$}11\mbox{,}186.81$.

\soln Use the formula for compound interest.  In the case of interest
compounded instantaneously, the formula is:
$P_{instant}(t) = P_0e^{rt}$.  The interest rate is given as 7.5\%, so
$r = 0.075$.  Thus,
$P_{instant}(t) = \mbox{\$}10\mbox{,}000e^{0.075t}$.
We then compute the amount of money in the account after a year
and a half by setting $t = 1.5$.

\para If interest is compounded monthly, then
\[
P_{monthly}(t) = P_0\left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} =
\mbox{\$}10\mbox{,}000\left(1 + \frac{0.075}{12}\right)^{12t}
\]
Again, set $t = 1.5$ to find the principal after a year and a half.

\begin{exercise} \label{c3.3.4}
The differential equation
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} =  x^2
\]
has an equilibrium at the origin.  Determine
those $x_0$ for which solutions to the initial value $x(0)=x_0$ tend
towards the origin.

\begin{solution}
Solutions to $\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2$ tend towards the origin for $x_0 < 0$
and tend away from the origin for $x_0 > 0$.
\end{solution}

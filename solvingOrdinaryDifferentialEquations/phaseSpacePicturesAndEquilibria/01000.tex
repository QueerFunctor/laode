Sketch the time series for the solution to the differential
equation pictured in Figure~\ref{pitch3}(b) with initial condition
$x(0)=\frac{1}{2}$.  Use only the phase space plot given in this
figure.  Use {\dfield} to verify your answer.

\begin{solution}

Figure \ref{pitch3}(b) is a schematic
phase line diagram of the equation $x' = x(1 - x^2)$.  According
to that figure, the initial point $x(0) = \frac{1}{2}$ is between
the stable equilibrium $x = 1$ and the unstable equilibrium
$x = 0$.  Therefore, as $t$ increases from $t = 0$, $x(t)$
approaches $1$; and as $t$ decreases from $t = 0$, $x(t)$
approaches $0$.  Specifically, your time series should resemble
the {\tt dfield5} diagram in Figure \ref{c3.3.8}.

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c4.5.6}
Consider the matrix $A$ and vector $X_0$ given by
\[
A=\mattwo{2}{1}{0}{1}\AND X_0=\vectwo{1}{1}.
\]
Use {\sf map} to compute $X_1 = AX_0$, $X_2 = AX_1$, $X_3=AX_2$ etc.\ by a
repeated use of the {\sf Map} button in the {\sf MAP Display} window.  What
do you observe?  What happens if you start the iteration process with a
different choice for $X_0$, and, in particular, for an $X_0$ that is close
to $\vectwo{-1}{1}$?

\begin{solution}

For each iteration, the $y$-coordinate of the solution is $1$.  After a
number of iterations, the $x$-coordinate approaches infinity, so the
direction of the solution vector approaches $(1,0)$, which, as shown
in Exercise~\ref{c4.5.5a}, is an eigenvector of $A$.  For any $X_0
\neq (-1,1)$, the solution vector approaches the direction
$(1,0)$.  If $X_0 = (-1,1)$ or some multiple thereof, then the solution
vectors remains on the line $y = -x$, since $(-1,1)$ is also an
eigenvector of $A$.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}

\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c4.5.5a} -- \ref{c4.5.5b} use {\sf map} to find
an (approximate) eigenvector for the given matrix.  {\bf Hint:} Choose a
vector in {\sf map} and repeatedly click on the button {\sf Map} until the
vector maps to a multiple of itself.  You may wish to use the {\sf Rescale} 
feature in the {\sf MAP Options}.  Then the length of the vector is rescaled 
to one after each use of the command {\sf Map}. In this way, you can avoid
overflows in the computations while still being able to see the
directions where the vectors are moved by the matrix mapping.  The coordinates 
of the new vector obtained by applying {\sf map} can be viewed in the 
{\sf Vector input} window.

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c4.5.5a}
$B=\mattwo{2}{-2}{2}{7}$.

\begin{solution}
The vector $(-1,2)^t$ is an eigenvector of $B$ with
corresponding eigenvalue $6$, and $(-2,1)^t$ is an eigenvector with
corresponding eigenvalue $3$.

\begin{exercise}  \label{c4.9.6A}
Suppose that $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix with zero as an eigenvalue.
Show that $A$ is not invertible.  {\bf Hint:}  Assume that $A$ is invertible 
and compute $A\inv Av$ where $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to 
the zero eigenvalue.

\begin{solution}
\soln
Suppose that $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix with zero eigenvalue.  We need to
prove that $A$ is not invertible.  Let $v\in\R^n$ be a nonzero 
eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue.  Therefore, $Av=0$. 
Suppose that $A\inv$ exists.  Then
\[
v = I_nv = A\inv Av = A\inv 0 = 0,
\]
which is a contradiction.  Therefore, $A$ is not invertible.

Recall that in a {\em phase space\/} \index{phase!space} plot, the 
solution $x(t)$ represents the position $x$ of a particle on a line 
for each time $t$.  In general, phase space plots are difficult to draw, since 
motion must be built into the plot.  However, phase space plots can be drawn for
 autonomous, first order differential equations; that is, equations of the
form
\[
\dot{x} = g(x).
\]

\subsection*{Equilibria and Dynamics}

The simplest solution to a differential equation is a solution
that remains constant for all time.  Such solutions are called
{\em equilibria\/}.  Equilibria are found as follows:
\begin{lemma}  \label{L:equilibria}
Consider the autonomous \index{autonomous} differential equation
\begin{equation} \label{aut}
\frac{dx}{dt}(t) = g(x(t)).
\end{equation}
Then $x(t)=x_0$ is an equilibrium \index{equilibrium} if and only
if $g(x_0)=0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Suppose that $x(t)=x_0$ is an equilibrium solution to
\eqref{aut}. Then $g(x_0)=0$, since $dx/dt = 0$.  Conversely,
suppose $g(x_0)=0$.  Then $x(t)=x_0$ is a solution to \eqref{aut}.
\end{proof}

For  example, consider the autonomous equation $g(x)=-0.8x$ 
whose solutions have the form $x(t) = Ke^{-0.8t}$ when starting 
at $t=0$ with initial condition $K=x(0)$.  That is, the limit of 
$x(t)$ as $t\to\infty$ is $x=0$.

An equilibrium $y(t)=y_0$ is {\em asymptotically stable\/}
\index{stability!asymptotic} if all solutions $y(t)$ with
initial condition $z(0)$ near $y_0$ have the limit
$y_0$ as $t$ goes to infinity.  In symbols we require
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty} y(t) = x_0.
\]
(The definition of asymptotic stability is more complicated in
higher dimensions.) The equilibrium $x(t)=x_0$ is {\em unstable\/}
\index{unstable} if trajectories starting near $x_0$ move away
from $x_0$.  Thus, in
our example, the equilibrium $x=0$ is {\em asymptotically
stable\/} when $\lambda< 0$ and {\em unstable\/}
when $\lambda> 0$.

\subsubsection*{Hyperbolic Equilibria}

Suppose that $x_0$ is an equilibrium for \eqref{aut}; that is suppose
$g(x_0)=0$.  We denote the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$, 
$dg/dx$, by $g'$.  The equilibrium $x_0$ is 
{\em hyperbolic\/} \index{hyperbolic}
if $g'(x_0)\neq 0$.  Assume that $x_0$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium and use
the tangent line approximation to $g(x)$ near $x_0$
($\Delta g = g'(x_0)\Delta x$) and that fact that $g(x_0)=0$ to conclude that
\[
g(x) \approx g'(x_0)(x-x_0).
\]
It follows that if $g'(x_0)<0$, then $g(x)$ is negative when
$x>x_0$ and positive when $x<x_0$.  So when $g'(x_0)<0$,
solutions of \eqref{aut} starting just to the right of $x_0$ will
move left ($g<0$) and tend towards $x_0$ and solutions starting
just to the left of $x_0$ will move right ($g>0$) and tend
towards $x_0$.  Similarly, if $g'(x_0)>0$, then $g(x)$ is positive
when $x>x_0$ and negative when $x<x_0$.  Thus, solutions near $x_0$ 
will tend away from $x_0$ when $g'(x_0)>0$.    We  have shown:
\begin{theorem}[Stability of Hyperbolic Equilibria] \label{T:stability1}
Let $x_0$ be a hyperbolic equilibrium for the differential equation
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = g(x).
\]
If $g'(x_0)<0$, then the equilibrium is asymptotically stable;
and if $g'(x_0)>0$, then the equilibrium is unstable.
\end{theorem} \index{equilibrium} \index{stability!asymptotic}
\index{unstable}

The dynamical behavior of autonomous differential equations of
the form \eqref{aut} is essentially determined by the equilibria
of $g$.  We explore this statement by considering the dynamical 
behavior of 
\begin{equation} \label{pitch_eq}
	\dot{x} = g(x) = x-x^3.
\end{equation}
There are three equilibria of \eqref{pitch_eq} and they are found 
by solving $g(x) = 0$ for $x = -1,0,1$. Each of these equilibria are 
hyperbolic since $g'(-1) = -2$, $g'(0) = 1$, and $g'(1) = -2$.  Moreover, 
the equilibria at $\pm 1$ are asymptotically stable and the equilibrium 
at the origin is unstable.  Therefore, the phase line for \eqref{pitch_eq}
is shown schematically in Figure~\ref{pitch3}(b).

As a second example consider the differential equation \eqref{pitch_eq2}
\begin{equation} \label{pitch_eq2}
	\dot{x} = g(x) = -x-x^3.
\end{equation}
Note that this equation has only one equilibrium at $x=0$ and that 
equilibrium is stabe since $g'(0) = -1$.  The phase line for \eqref{pitch_eq2}
is given schematically in Figure~\ref{pitch3}(a).

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{Schematic dynamics of (a) $\dot{x}=x(-1-x^2)$ and (b) $\dot{x}=x(1-x^2)$.}
\label{pitch3}
\end{figure}

We can now discuss a method for completely determining the
dynamics of a single autonomous differential equation \eqref{aut}
--- assuming that equilibria are isolated.

\begin{itemize}
\item Determine all equilibria of \eqref{aut} by solving the
equation $g(x)=0$.
\item Choose an initial point between each pair of consecutive
equilibria and determine the direction of motion (sign of $g$) at
that initial point. This can be done either directly or by using
{\sf matlab}.
\item On a line plot the equilibria \index{equilibrium} and
connect them by arrows indicating the direction of the dynamics.
\end{itemize}




\subsection*{Comparing Phase Lines and Time Series}
\index{phase!line}\index{time series}

Phase line plots and time series graphs give different ways of
presenting the same information.  With that point in mind, it is
important to be able to recreate one type of plot from
the other.  For example, let $x(t)$ be the solution to the
differential equation $\dot{x}=x(1-x^2)$ with initial condition $x(0)=2$.
In Figure~\ref{pitch3}(b) we have drawn the schematic phase line for
all solutions to this differential equation. How can we reconstruct
a (schematic) graph of the time series $x(t)$ for this solution just
from the phase line?

To answer this question, note that in Figure~\ref{pitch3}(b) the
initial condition $x(0)=2$ lies to the right of all equilibria of
this equation, and the arrow indicates that solution trajectories
starting in this area move to the left, that is, they decrease to
the equilibrium at $x=1$.  It follows that
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty} x(t) = 1.
\]
Since there are no equilibria to the right of $x=2$, the graph of $x(t)$
must increase to infinity in {\em backwards\/} time.  So the graph of 
$x=x(t)$ is decreasing and asymptotic to $x=1$ for large positive $t$.  
A schematic graph is given in Figure~\ref{pitch3a}(a).  Using {\dfield} 
we can check this description by numerically integrating the differential
equation.   This graph is shown in Figure~\ref{pitch3a}(b).

given in Figure~\ref{F:exer3ad} to answer the following:\\
\noindent (a) Is the differential equation that was used to draw this figure 
autonomous or nonautonomous.\\
\noindent (b)  If the differential equation is autonomous, then draw the phase
line noting the values of $x$ where equilibria occur and whether they are

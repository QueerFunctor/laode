Suppose that $a=d<0$.  Verify experimentally using {\pplane}
that all trajectories approach the origin along straight lines.
Try to prove this conjecture?

\begin{solution}

If $A = D < 0$, the equations for the system will be
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{dx}{dt}(t) & = & Ax(t) \\
\frac{dy}{dt}(t) & = & Ay(t)\end{array}. \]
Therefore,
\[ x(t) = x_0e^{At} \AND y(t) = y_0e^{At}. \]
Solve the first equation for $e^{At}$ and substitute into the
second, obtaining \[ y(t) = \frac{y_0}{x_0}x(t). \]
Since $\frac{y_0}{x_0}$ is a constant, all trajectories are
straight lines.  Since $A < 0$, all trajectories go toward the
origin as $t$ increases.

\begin{exercise} \label{c3.2.1*}
Compute $x(2)$, where $x(t)$ is the solution to the differential equation 
$\dot{x} = 0.6x$ with initial condition $x(0)=0.5$, in two different ways, 
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Use {\sf Keyboard input} in {\dfield} to compute the 
solution with initial value $x(0)=0.5$.  Use the {\sf zoom in} feature in 
the {\sf DFIELD8 Edit} menu to compute $x(2)$ to an accuracy of two decimal 
places.  (Drag a rectangle around the point you are interested in.  Repeat 
this several times until you can read off the value $x(2)$ of the solution.)  
\item[(b)] Use \Matlab to compute the value of the exact solution
of the form \eqref{soln1} with initial value $x(0)=0.5$.  
\item[(c)] Is your answer obtained using {\dfield} in (a) accurate to 
within two decimal places of the answer obtained using (b)?  If not, 
which answer do you trust more, and why?
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans Using {\tt dfield5}, find $x(2) \approx 1.66$.

\soln In {\tt dfield5}, change the equation to {\tt x$'$ = 0.6*x}, then
use keyboard input to enter the point $x(0) = 0.5$.  The graph should
resemble Figure \ref{c3.2.1*}a.  Zoom in on the graph at $x = 2$ to get a
picture similar to Figure \ref{c3.2.1*}b.

(b) \ans \Matlabp's algebraic solution is $x(2) \approx 1.66$.

\soln Use the initial value $x(0) = 0.5$ to find that the solution to
$\frac{dx}{dt} = 0.6x$ is $x(t) = 0.5e^{0.6t}$.  In \Matlabp, find $x(2)$
by typing {\tt x2 = 0.5 * exp(0.6*2)}.
\Matlab responds with
\begin{verbatim}
x2 =
    1.6601
\end{verbatim}

(c) To two decimal places, this answer is $x(2) = 1.66$, so the
{\tt dfield5} answer of $x(2) = 1.70$ is not accurate to two decimal
places.  The algebraic solution is more accurate, since $x(t) = 0.5e^{0.6t}$
is an exact solution to the differential equation.

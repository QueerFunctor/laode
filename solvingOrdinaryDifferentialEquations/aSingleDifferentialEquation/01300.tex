Two banks each pay $7\%$ interest per year --- one compounds money
daily and one compounds money continuously.  What is the difference
in earnings in one year in an account having \$10,000.

\begin{solution}

\ans The difference in earnings is 7 cents.

\soln Compute this using the interest
formula, since we are given that the principal $P_0 = \$10\mbox{,}000$,
the interest rate $r = 0.07$, and $t = 1$.  So we can substitute
these values into the interest formulas and find the amount of money
in each account after 1 year.  The formula for interest compounded daily is
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
P(t) & = & P_0\left(1 + \frac{r}{365}\right)^{365t} \\
P(1) & = & \$10\mbox{,}000\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{365}\right)^{365} \\
P(1) & = & \$10\mbox{,}725.01\end{array}
\]
To find the amount of money in the account at the other bank, we substitute
into the formula for interest compounded instantaneously:
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
P(t) & = & P_0e^{rt} \\
P(1) & = & \$10\mbox{,}000e^{0.07} \\
P(1) & = & \$10\mbox{,}725.08\end{array}
\]

\end{solution}

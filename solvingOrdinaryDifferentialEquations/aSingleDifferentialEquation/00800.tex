Let $p(t)$ be the population of group Grk at time $t$ measured in years.
Let $r$ be the growth rate of the group Grk.  Suppose that the population
of Grks changes according to the differential equation \eqref{pop_model}.
Find $r$ so that the population of Grks doubles every $50$ years.  How
large must $r$ be so that the population doubles every $25$ years?

\begin{solution}

\ans If the population doubles every $50$ years, then
$r = \frac{1}{50}(\ln 2)$.  If the population doubles every $25$
years, then $r = \frac{1}{25}(\ln 2)$.

\soln Use the given equation $\frac{dp}{dt}(t) = rp(t)$,
from which we can infer $p(t) = p_0e^{rt}$.
The population doubles every $50$ years, so $p(50) = 2p_0$.  We
can substitute this value for $p(50)$ into the population formula
and solve for $r$.  That is,
\[
2p_0 = p(50) = p_0e^{50r}.
\]

In the same way, we can solve for the rate of growth if the population
doubles every $25$ years, by substituting $p(25) = 2p_0$ into the
population formula.

Matrices}
\rhead{S:2.1}{SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS AND MATRICES}

\exer{c2.1.8a} $(x,y) = (2,4)$.

\exer{c2.1.8c} $(x,y) = (-4,1)$.

\exer{c2.1.9}
\ans The system in part (a) has an infinite number of solutions, whereas
the system in part (b) has no solution.

\soln (a) Replace $x$ in the second and third equations with
$4 + y$ to obtain $4y - 2z = -10$ and $6y - 3z = -15$.  Since these
equations have identical solutions, the system can be restated as
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
x & = & y & + & 4 \\ 
z & = & -2y & + & 5\end{array}
\]
So, for each choice of $y$, there exists a single solution.  For
example, if $y = 1$, then $x = 5$ and $z = 3$; or if $y = 0$, then
$x = 4$ and $z = 5$.

(b) If we again substitute for $x$ using the first equation, the
second and third equations become
\[
2y - 3z = -2 \AND 2y - 3z = -4
\]

These two expressions contradict each other, so there is no solution
for this system.

\exer{c2.1.11}
(a) \ans The quadratic $p(x) = -x^2 + 5x + 1$ satisfies these conditions.

\soln Since $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for any quadratic equation, we find
this solution by evaluating $p(0) = 1$, $p(1) = 5$, and $p(-1) = -5$,
which yields the system of equations
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrr}
p(0) & = & & & & & c & = & 1 \\
p(1) & = & a & + & b & + & c & = & 5 \\
p(-1) & = & a & - & b & + & c & = & -5\end{array}
\]
We solve this system to obtain $(a,b,c) = (-1,5,1)$, then substitute
these coefficients into the general quadratic.

(b) Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be a quadratic equation.  Then, the
assumptions $p(0) = L$, $p(1) = M$, and $p(-1) = N$ imply:
\[
\begin{array}{lrrrrrrrr}
p(0) & = & & & & & c & = & L \\
p(1) & = & a & + & b & + & c & = & M \\
p(-1) & = & a & - & b & + & c & = & N\end{array}
\]
The unique solution to this system is $(a,b,c) =
(\frac{M + N - 2L}{2},\frac{M - N}{2},L)$.

(c) Substituting $q(x_i) = A_i$, for $i = 1,2,3$, into the standard
quadratic equation $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ yields
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
ax_1^2 & + & bx_1 & + & c & = & A_1 \\
ax_2^2 & + & bx_2 & + & c & = & A_2 \\
ax_3^2 & + & bx_3 & + & c & = & A_3\end{array}
\]
Finding the appropriate quadratic polynomial would be equivalent to
solving this system of linear equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$ in
terms of $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$.

\exer{c2.1.2} Type {\tt A(2,1) = -5}.  \Matlab responds with
\begin{verbatim}
A =
    -1     1     2
    -5     1     2
\end{verbatim}

\exer{c2.1.4} \ans According to \Matlabp,
\begin{verbatim}
ans =
  -12.0495
   -0.8889
    7.8384
\end{verbatim}
\soln Write the system as $Ax = b$, where:
\begin{verbatim}
A =                                             b = 
    2.0000   -4.5000    3.1000                     4.2000
    1.0000    1.0000    1.0000                    -5.1000
    1.0000   -6.2000    1.0000                     1.3000
\end{verbatim}
then type {\tt A}$\backslash${\tt b} to solve.

\subsection*{Section~\protect{\ref{S:2.2}} The Geometry of Low-Dimensional
Solutions}
\rhead{S:2.2}{THE GEOMETRY OF LOW-DIMENSIONAL SOLUTIONS}

\exer{c2.2.5}
\ans The equation of the desired plane is $2x + 3y + z = -5$.

\soln Note that a vector perpendicular to a plane is orthogonal
to any vector connecting two points in the plane.  So,
if $X_0 = (-1,-2,3)$ is one point in the plane perpendicular to
$N = (2,3,1)$ and $X = (x,y,z)$ is any other point in that plane,
then $(X - X_0) \cdot N = 0$.  Substituting into this formula, we obtain
\[
2(x + 1) + 3(y + 1) + 1(z - 3) = 0\quad\mbox{or}\quad
2x + 3y + z = -5.
\]

\exer{c2.2.7}
\ans The equation for the plane is $z = x$.

\soln Note that the plane goes through the origin and contains the
vectors $(1,0,1)$ and $(2,-1,2)$, and therefore contains the points
$(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, and $(2,-1,2)$.  The general equation for a plane
is $ax + by + cz = d$.  We can substitute the coordinates of the three
points into this equation to get the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
 & & & & 0 & = & d \\
a & & & + & c & = & d \\
2a & - & b & + & 2c & = & d\end{array}
\]
We can solve the system by substitution to get $b = d = 0$ and $a = -c$,
which yields the equation of the plane.

\exer{c2.2.9}
(a) $u = (2,2,1)$, since we know that the normal vector to the plane
$ax + by + cz = d$ is $(a,b,c)$.

(b) $v = (1,1,2)$.

(c) $\cos\theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{||u||\;||v||} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}$.
In \Matlabp, type {\tt acos(2/sqrt(6))*180/pi} to obtain $\theta =
35.2644^\circ$.

\exer{c2.2.1}
\ans $(x,y) \approx (2.15,-1.54)$.

\soln In \Matlab, graph the system by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
x = linspace(-5,5,100);
y = -1 - x/4;
plot(x,y)
xlabel('x')
ylabel('y')
hold on
y = 4/3 - 4*x/3;
plot(x,y)
axis('equal')
grid
\end{verbatim}

Using the {\tt zoom} command, we can zoom in on the graph of
Figure~\ref{c2.2.1} until the intersection of the lines is
visible at an accuracy of two decimal places.  

\begin{figure}[htb]
                       \centerline{%
                       \psfig{file=exfigure/2-2-1a.eps,width=2.75in}
                       \psfig{file=exfigure/2-2-1b.eps,width=2.75in}}
		\exercaptwo{c2.2.1}
\end{figure}

\exer{c2.2.3}
\ans $(x,y,z) = (1,3,-1)$.

\soln The commands to instruct \Matlab to graph this three dimensional
system are:
\begin{verbatim}
[x,y] = meshgrid(-10:0.5:10);
z = (-11 - 3*x + 4*y)/2;
surf(x,y,z)
hold on 
z = 7 - 2*x - 2*y;
surf(x,y,z)
hold on
z = (7 + x - y)/(-5);
surf(x,y,z)
\end{verbatim}
It is hard to determine a solution for the system from this graph.
The command {\tt axis([xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax])} can make the
graph clearer by zooming in on a specific range of points, but a
numerically accurate solution is difficult to obtain graphically in
three dimensions.  Obtain an accurate solution using the command
{\tt A}$\backslash${\tt b} in \Matlabp.

\exer{c2.2.a5}
\ans The function has three relative maxima on this interval.

\soln Graph the function in \Matlab using the commands:
\begin{verbatim}
x = linspace(-2,3);
y = 2 - x*sin(x^2 - 1);
plot(x,y)
\end{verbatim}
Determine the number of relative maxima numerically from the graph, which
is shown in Figure~\ref{c2.2.a5}.

\subsection*{Section~\protect{\ref{S:Gauss}} Gaussian Elimination}
\rhead{S:Gauss}{GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION}

\exer{c2.3.6a} The matrix is not in reduced echelon form.

\exer{c2.3.6c} The matrix is not in reduced echelon form.

\exer{c2.3.7b} The $1^{st}$, $3^{rd}$, and $5^{th}$ columns of the matrix
contain pivots.  Since the last row of the matrix translates to the linear
equation $0 = 1$, the system is inconsistent, and there are no solutions.

\exer{c2.3.8}
(a)
Two matrices are row equivalent if there is a sequence of row operations
that leads from one to the other.  In this case:

1. Divide the $1^{st}$ row of \Ref{e:2x2} by $a$.

2. Subtract $c$ times the $1^{st}$ row from the $2^{nd}$ row.

The result is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \frac{b}{a} \\ 0 & \frac{a - bc}{a}\end{array}
\right).
\]

(b) If $a \neq bc$, then we can row reduce \Ref{e:2x2} to $I_2$ by
performing the two row operations in part (a), followed by:

3. Multiply the $2^{nd}$ row by $\frac{a}{a - bc}$.

4. Subtract $\frac{b}{a}$ times the second row from the first row.

This will give us the identity matrix $I_2$.

\para If $a = bc$, then $\frac{a - bc}{a} = 0$, and the matrix is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \frac{b}{a} \\ 0 & 0\end{array} \right).
\]
which has only one pivot and cannot be row reduced to $I_2$.

\exer{c2.3.10a} The augmented matrix for this system is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\ 4 & 1 & 1 & 5 \\
2 & 3 & -1 & 2\end{array}\right)
\]
We can row reduce this matrix to reduced echelon form, obtaining
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 & 0 & \frac{2}{5} & \frac{6}{5} \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{3}{5} & \frac{1}{5} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right)
\]
The last row of the reduced system implies that $0 = 1$, so the system
is inconsistent and has no solutions.

\exer{c2.3.11a}
\ans (a) The system has infinitely many solutions.

(b) One variable can be assigned arbitrary values.

\soln The row-reduced form of the matrix is:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 &
\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right).
\]

\exer{c2.3.11c}
\ans The system has a unique solution.

\soln The row-reduced form of the matrix is:
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rrr|r} 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \frac{2}{5}
\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \frac{3}{4}\end{array}\right).
\]

\exer{c2.3.12a} \ans The system is linear.

\exer{c2.3.12c} \ans The system is not linear.

\soln The term $3x_1x_2$ contains two variables, and the term $x_2^2$
contains a variable squared.  Thus, these terms are not linear.

\newpage
\exer{c2.3.12e} \ans The system is not linear.

\soln The term $\sin(x_2)$ is not linear.

\exer{c2.3.1b} The row-reduced matrix is:
\begin{verbatim}
A =
    1.0000   -1.3333         0    0.6667
         0    1.0000    1.5000    0.5000
         0         0    1.0000   -0.1429
\end{verbatim}
This matrix represents a consistent linear system.

\exer{c2.3.2} The row echelon form is:
\begin{verbatim}
A = 
       0   1.0000   2.0000   1.0000  14.0000  21.0000        0  -1.0000
       0        0        0   1.0000   3.0000   5.0000        0   9.0000

       0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0

\begin{verbatim}
A =
   1.0000e+00   3.0000e+00   4.0000e+00
            0   1.0000e+00   1.4000e+00
            0            0            0

$B = \left(\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{4}{3} \\

(c)
\begin{verbatim}
B =
   1.0000e+00   3.3333e-01   1.3333e+00
            0   1.0000e+00  -2.0000e-01
            0            0   2.2204e-16
\end{verbatim}


(d) Note that switching the first two columns of matrix {\tt A} produces
matrix {\tt B}.  Suppose that {\tt A} and {\tt B} represent the left-hand
sides of linear systems with the same vector representing the right-hand
sides.  If the solution of system {\tt A} is $(x,y,z) = (a,b,c)$, then the
solution of system {\tt B} should be $(x,y,z) = (b,a,c)$.  However,
according to the row reduced matrices produced by \Matlab, the system
corresponding to {\tt B} has a unique solution, and the system
corresponding to {\tt A} does not.  Row reducing {\tt B} by hand shows
that there is not a unique solution.  \Matlab provides one because of 
roundoff error.  The division by 3 in the first step of the row reduction
for {\tt B} causes a rounding inaccuracy.  Because of this, \Matlab
eventually computes a very small nonzero value for {\tt B}$(3,3)$
rather than the correct answer of 0.



\subsection*{Section~\protect{\ref{S:2.4}} Reduction to Echelon Form}
\rhead{S:2.4}{REDUCTION TO ECHELON FORM}

\exer{c2.4.1}
The reduced echelon form of the matrix is:
\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 & 2 & 0 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0
& 0\end{array}\right)
\]
The rank of $A$ is two, since the reduced echelon matrix has two nonzero
rows.

\exer{c2.4.2}
\ans Four parameters are needed to specify all solutions.

\soln According to Theorem \ref{number}, $n - \ell$
parameters are needed to parameterize the set of all solutions of a
linear system, where $n$ is the number of unknowns, and $\ell$ is the
rank of the reduced echelon matrix.  In this case, $n = 7$ and $\ell =
3$.

\exer{c2.4.3a}
\ans Matrix $A$ is consistent and requires 3 parameters to enumerate
all solutions.

\exer{c2.4.3c}
\ans Matrix $C$ is inconsistent.

\exer{c2.4.4a} \ans The rank of the matrix is $1$.

\soln Use the \Matlab command {\tt rank(A)} to determine the rank of a 
matrix $A$.

\newpage
\exer{c2.4.4c} The rank of the matrix is $2$.

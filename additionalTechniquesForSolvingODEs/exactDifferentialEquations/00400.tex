\begin{exercise}  \label{ex:if}
Show that the differential equation
\begin{equation} \label{Ex:nexact}
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{1+3tx}{t^2}
\end{equation}
is not exact.  Now multiply both the numerator and denominator of the 
right side of \eqref{Ex:nexact} by $t$ and show that this `new' differential
equation 
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{t+3t^2x}{t^3}
\]
is exact. Now find all solutions to \eqref{Ex:nexact}.

\begin{solution}
\ans The general solution is 
\[ x = \frac{C}{t^3} - \frac{1}{2t} \] 
for some constant $C$.

\soln We can write the differential equation as $\dps\frac{dx}{dt} =
\frac{G(t,x)}{H(t,x)}$, where $G(t,x) = -1-3tx$ and $H(t,x) = t^2$. 
Then we compute
\[
-\frac{\partial G}{\partial x} = 3t \AND
\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = 2t.
\]
By Proposition~\ref{prop:exact}, the
differential equation is exact only if the two sides of \eqref{eq:Gy=Hs} are
equal.
On multiplying numerator and denominator by $t$ we obtain
where $G(t,x) = -t-3t^2x$ and $H(t,x) = t^3$. 
Then we compute
\[
-\frac{\partial G}{\partial x} = 3t^2 \AND
\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = 3t^2.
\]
So the new form of the differential equation is exact.

Next, we must find a function $F(t,x)$ satisfying \eqref{eq:excond}.
By integration, obtain
\[
\Omega(t,x) = \int H(t,x)dx = \int t^3dx = t^3x.
\]
Then, find the function $h(t)$ such that
\[
h'(t) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Omega(t,x) - G(t,x)
= t.
\]
In this case, we can choose 
\[
h(t) =  \frac{1}{2}t^2.  
\]
Finally, compute
\[
F(t,x) = \Omega(t,x) + h(t) = t^3x + \frac{1}{2}t^2,
\]
the function satisfying \eqref{eq:excond}.  The general solution is found by 
solving $F=C$ for $x$; that is, solving
\[
\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t^3x = C.
\]

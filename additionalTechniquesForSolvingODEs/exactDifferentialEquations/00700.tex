\begin{exercise} \label{c14.6.7A}
Use the result of Exercise~\ref{c14.6.7} to find an integrating factor for 
the differential equation
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{8x+5t}{4t},
\]
and then determine all solutions of this differential equation.

\begin{solution}
\ans $x(t) = \dps\frac{C}{4t^2} - \frac{5}{12}t$.

\soln  For the given differential equation $G(x,t)=-8x-5t$ and $H(x,t)=4t$. 
Since $-G_x=8$ and $H_t=4$, it follows that the differential equation is not
exact.  We solve (\ref{EX:if}) for an integrating factor $\rho(t)$.  That is,
we solve
\[
\rho_t = -\rho\frac{-8+4}{4t} = \frac{1}{t}\rho.
\]
We can use separation of variable to solve this equation.  That is,
\[
\frac{\rho_t}{\rho} =  \frac{1}{t}.
\]
On integration we find that $\rho=t$ is a solution.

To verify that $\rho(t)=t$ is an integrating factor, let $G(x,t)=-8xt-5t^2$
and $H(x,t)=4t^2$.  Then 
\[
-G_x = 8t \AND H_t = 8t,
\]
so that this equation is exact.

Next, we must find a function $F(t,x)$ satisfying \eqref{eq:excond}.  By
integration, obtain
\[
\Omega(t,x) = \int H(t,x)dx = \int 4t^2dx = 4t^2x.
\]
Then, find the function $h(t)$ such that
\[
h'(t) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Omega(t,x) - G(t,x) = 5t^2.
\]
In this case, we can choose 
\[
h(t) =  \frac{5}{3}t^3.  
\]
Finally, compute
\[
F(t,x) = \Omega(t,x) + h(t) = 4t^2x + \frac{5}{3}t^3,
\]
the function satisfying \eqref{eq:excond}.  The general solution is found by 
solving $F=C$ for $x$; that is, solving
\[
4t^2x + \frac{5}{3}t^3 = C.
\]

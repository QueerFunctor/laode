In Chapters~\ref{C:HDS}, \ref{C:LDE}, and \ref{C:LT} we developed analytic 
methods for finding solutions to {\em linear differential equations\/} with 
constant coefficients and with forcing.  In this chapter we show how to find 
closed form solutions to certain types of nonlinear equations as well as to 
certain linear equations with time dependent coefficients.

Most nonlinear differential equations cannot be solved analytically and   
for these equations one has to rely either on advanced theory or on 
numerical methods.  There are, however, specific types of ordinary differential 
equations whose solution by hand is possible.  In this chapter we describe 
several of these types.  In Sections~\ref{sec:VarConstS} and 
\ref{sec:LinInhomSys} we solve forced nonconstant coefficient linear 
differential equations and systems using {\em variation of parameters}.  In 
Section~\ref{S:RO} we show how to solve higher order equations by reduction 
to first order systems and by a variant of variation of parameters called 
{\em reduction of order\/}.  
Sometimes it is possible to transform a nonlinear equation into an equation 
that can be treated by one of the methods mentioned above.  This is 
accomplished by substituting another function for the function $x(t)$ in a suitable way.  {\em Simplifications by substitution\/} are discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:SBS}.  

The chapter ends with a discussion of two types of 
differential equations whose solutions lie on level curves of a real-valued 
function: nonautonomous {\em exact differential equations\/} and autonomous 
{\em Hamiltonian systems}.  Exact equations are treated in 
Section~\ref{S:exact}.   Hamiltonian systems, which arise naturally in 
mechanical systems, are treated in Section~\ref{sec:HamSys}.

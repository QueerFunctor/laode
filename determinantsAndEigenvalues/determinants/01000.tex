Suppose that two $n\times p$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are row
equivalent. \index{row!equivalent} Show that there is an invertible
$n\times n$ matrix $P$ such that $B = PA$.

\begin{solution}

By Proposition~\ref{P:ERO}, every
elementary row operation on $A$ can be represented by an invertible $n
\times n$ matrix $E$.  That is, the matrix $EA$ is row equivalent to
$A$.  If $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent, then there exist matrices
$E_j$ such that $B = E_k\ldots E_1A$.  The product of invertible $n
\times n$ matrices is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix.  Thus $P =
E_k\ldots E_1$ is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix such that $B =
PA$.

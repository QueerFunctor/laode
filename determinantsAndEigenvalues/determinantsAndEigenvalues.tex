In Section~\ref{S:det2x2} we introduced determinants for $2\times 2$
matrices $A$.  There we showed that the determinant of $A$
is nonzero if and only if $A$ is invertible.  In Section~\ref{S:evchp} 
we saw that the eigenvalues of $A$ are the roots of its 
characteristic polynomial, and that its characteristic polynomial
is just the determinant of a related matrix, namely, 
$p_A(\lambda) = \det(A-\lambda I_2)$. 

In Section~\ref{S:det} we generalize the concept of determinants to
$n\times n$ matrices, and in Section~\ref{S:eig} we use determinants 
to show that every $n\times n$ matrix has exactly $n$ eigenvalues --- 
the roots of its characteristic polynomial.  Properties of eigenvalues 
are also discussed in detail in Section~\ref{S:eig}.\index{eigenvalue}
Certain details concerning determinants are deferred to Appendix~\ref{A:det}.

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c13.3.4}
The {\tt residue} command in \Matlab also works when the degree of the
numerator $p(s)$ is greater than the degree of the denominator $q(s)$.
In this case the answer has the form `partial fractions + polynomial'.
The {\tt residue} command stores the polynomial part in a vector {\tt k}.
To explore this feature, enter the vectors {\tt p = [2,0,-2,0]} and
{\tt q = [1,0,-4]}, and type the command
\begin{verbatim}
[c,r,k] = residue(p,q)
\end{verbatim}
Explain the result of this calculation by comparing it to the expansion
\[
\frac{2(s^3-s)}{s^2-4} = \frac{3}{s-2} + \frac{3}{s+2} +2s.
\]

\begin{solution}

\Matlab returns $c = (3,3)^t$, $r = (2,-2)^t$ and $k = (2,0)$.
Column vectors $c$ and $r$ correspond to the coefficients and roots of
the partial fractions, as expected.  The row vector $k =
(a_d,\dots,a_0)$ contains the coefficients of a polynomial of the form
$a_ds^d + \cdots + a_1s + a_0$.
